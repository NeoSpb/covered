Usage:  covered report (-h | -view | [<options>] <database_file>)

   -view                        Uses the graphical report viewer for viewing reports.  If this
                                 option is not specified, the text report will be generated.
   -h                           Displays this help information.

   Options:
      -m [l][t][c][f][r][a][m]  Type(s) of metrics to report.  l=line, t=toggle, c=combinational logic,
                                 f=FSM state/arc, r=race condition, a=assertion, m=memory.  Default is ltcf.
      -d (s|d|v)                Level of report detail (s=summary, d=detailed, v=verbose).
                                 Default is to display summary coverage information.
      -i                        Provides coverage information for instances instead of module/task/function.
      -c                        If '-d d' or '-d v' is specified, displays covered line, toggle
                                 and combinational cases.  Default is to display uncovered results.
      -o <filename>             File to output report information to.  Default is standard output.
      -w [<line_width>]         Causes expressions to be output to best-fit to the specified line
                                 width.  If the -w option is specified without a value, the default
                                 line width of 80 is used.  If the -w option is not specified, all
                                 expressions are output in the format that the user specified in the
                                 Verilog source.
      -s                        Suppress outputting modules/instances that do not contain any coverage metrics.
      -b                        If combinational logic verbose output is reported and the expression is a
                                 vector operation, this option outputs the coverage information on a bitwise basis.
