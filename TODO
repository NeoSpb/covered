The following items are known to be problems in the current code that need to be fixed
or features that are unimplemented/not complete that need to be done.

Legend
------
X   = This feature/fix has been completed and tested
IP  = In Progress

Build process
-------------


Score command
-------------
   1.  Add ability for user to specify FSM all possible states/state transitions
       for a particular FSM on a command-line basis.

   2.  Add ability to automatically extract all possible states/state transitions
       for a specified FSM.

   3.  Add ability to automatically locate and extract an FSM from the design
       without user intervention.

   4.  Add more Verilog-2001 constructs to parser.
	- config command
        - $random

   5.  Allow Covered to run simulation phases in parallel to increase performance.

   6.  Add feature to cause Covered to omit the simulation phase for toggle and
       FSM coverage results.

   7.  Add SystemVerilog features/syntax
IP      - typedef
IP      - struct
IP      - union
IP      - enum

   8.  Have Covered have the ability to generate XML CDD files.

   9.  Enhance the -rI option to allow the user to ignore certain types of race conditions.

   10. Add a configure option to allow the user to set the size of the vector ulong typedef
       to their own preference.


Merge command
-------------

   1.  Add ability to merge two CDDs from different parts of the same design

X  2.  Add -d and -ext options to allow the user to specify a directory and file extension type which Covered will
       automatically load CDD files from to merge.


Report command
--------------

   1.  Provide additional information in toggle coverage regarding port (interface) coverage.


Rank command
------------

X  1.  Add -d and -ext options to allow the user to specify a directory and file extension type which Covered will
       automatically load CDD files from to rank.

X  2.  Add code to remove duplicate CDD files automatically.

   3.  Fix reports so that the longest CDD name is used for formatting purposes.


GUI
---

X  1.  Allow the user to create a new CDD file from the GUI (won't require a terminal to use).

X  2.  Add graduated test analyzer window.


Documentation
-------------

   1.  Create script to convert DocBook format of documentation into HelpSystem format.


Miscellaneous
-------------

IP 1.  Add regression that produces known, achievable error conditions in the code.

IP 2.  Make all code splint clean.

   3.  Have parser generate dumpvars file to cause only needed signals by Covered to get dumped (performance enhancement).

X  4.  Add ability to create graduated test output in GUI and reports from merged CDD files.
