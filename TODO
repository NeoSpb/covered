The following items are known to be problems in the current code that need to be fixed
or features that are unimplemented/not complete that need to be done.

Legend
------
X   = This feature/fix has been completed and tested
IP  = In Progress

Score command
-------------
   1.  Add ability for user to specify FSM all possible states/state transitions
       for a particular FSM on a command-line basis.

X  2.  Add ability for user to specify FSM location and all possible states/state
       transitions for a particular FSM using inline $attribute calls.

   3.  Add ability to automatically extract all possible states/state transitions
       for a specified FSM.

   4.  Add ability to automatically locate and extract an FSM from the design
       without user intervention.

X  5.  Work on increasing performance of score command.

   6.  Add more Verilog-1995 constructs to parser.
       - loops (for, while, repeat)
       - tasks/functions

   7.  Add more Verilog-2001 constructs to parser.

   8.  Allow Covered to run simulation phases in parallel to increase performance.

   9.  Add feature to cause Covered to omit the simulation phase for toggle and
       FSM coverage results.

IP 10. Add race condition checkers.

   11. Add race condition information to CDD file for reporting purposes.

   12. Add ability to perform assignments for signals that are within modules being Covered.

Merge command
-------------


Report command
--------------

X  1.  Update look of text reports to make them more robust and comprehensible.

IP 2.  Work on GUI interface for report function.

Miscellaneous
-------------

IP 1.  Add regression that produces known, achievable error conditions in the code.

X  2.  Change name of signal to vsignal in stable release version.

GUI
---

X  1.  Add overwrite functions to signal, expression, and FSM types to allow for quicker
       closing of files and reopening.

X  2.  Add toggle and combinational logic verbose output

   3.  Add FSM coverage output

X  4.  Make TCL and TK libraries build better in configure scripts
