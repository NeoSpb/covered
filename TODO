The following items are known to be problems in the current code that need to be fixed
or features that are unimplemented/not complete that need to be done.

Legend
------
X   = This feature/fix has been completed and tested
IP  = In Progress

Score command
-------------
   1.  Add ability for user to specify FSM all possible states/state transitions
       for a particular FSM on a command-line basis.

   2.  Add ability to automatically extract all possible states/state transitions
       for a specified FSM.

   3.  Add ability to automatically locate and extract an FSM from the design
       without user intervention.

   4.  Add more Verilog-2001 constructs to parser.
X	- `ifndef
	- `elsif
	- `file
X	- `line
X	- task/function argument list
X	- constant functions (this needs support of the above for it to work)
	- automatic storage for functions/tasks (instead of static) - difficult!
X	! explicitly named parameters
X	- make sure that localparams cannot be modified by a defparam or SDF
	- generate command (extremely low priority)
X	! wildcard sensitivity list (@*)
	- Add signed capability (unsigned zero-fills unused bits while sign fills with MSB)
	- register assignment
	- variable multi-bit selects
X	- exponential power operator (**)
X	- >>> (fills sign bit with its value) and <<< (same as <<)
X	- pre-port parameter listing
X	- inline port declaration listing
	- NULL task/function ports (?)
	- arrays of instances
	- MAKE SURE THAT WE DOCUMENT IN THE USER'S GUIDE WHAT VERILOG-2001 CONSTRUCTS ARE
	  SUPPORTED AND NOT SUPPORTED!

   5.  Allow Covered to run simulation phases in parallel to increase performance.

   6.  Add feature to cause Covered to omit the simulation phase for toggle and
       FSM coverage results.

X  7.  Add support for reading LXT-style dumpfiles

Report command
--------------


Miscellaneous
-------------

IP 1.  Add regression that produces known, achievable error conditions in the code.


GUI
---

   1.  Add FSM coverage output

   2.  Add ability to turn on/off assertions and have coverage information automatically adjusted.
  
   3.  Add summary report for entire design (window)
