 \par What is an arc?
 This group of functions handles the allocation, initialization, deallocation, and manipulation
 of an arc array.  An arc array is a specialized, variable sized, compact byte array that contains
 all of the information necessary for storing state and state transition information for a single
 FSM within a design.  To store this information into as compact a representation as possible, the
 data is bit-packed into the array.

 \par
 The first 7 bytes of the array  are known as the "arc header".  Every arc array is required to have
 this information.  The layout of the header is shown below:

 \par
 <table>
   <tr> <td><strong>Byte</strong></td> <td><strong>Description</strong></td> </tr>
   <tr> <td> 0 </td> <td> Bits [ 7:0] of output state variable width </td> </tr>
   <tr> <td> 1 </td> <td> Bits [15:8] of output state variable width </td> </tr>
   <tr> <td> 2 </td> <td> Bits [ 7:0] of number of state transition entries currently allocated </td> </tr>
   <tr> <td> 3 </td> <td> Bits [15:8] of number of state transition entries currently allocated </td> </tr>
   <tr> <td> 4 </td> <td> Bits [ 7:0] of number of state transition entries currently occupied </td> </tr>
   <tr> <td> 5 </td> <td> Bits [15:8] of number of state transition entries currently occupied </td> </tr>
   <tr> <td> 6 </td> <td> Bits [ 7:0] of arc array supplemental field </td> </tr>
 </table>

 \par
 Note:  The arc array supplemental field contains miscellaneous information about this arc array.
 Currently, only bit 0 is used to indicate if the user has specified state transitions manually (using
 the Verilog-2001 inline attribute mechanism) or whether no state transitions are known prior to simulation.

 \par
 The rest of the bytes in the arc array represent a list of state transition <strong>entries</strong>.
 An entry contains enough information to describe a bidirectional state transition with coverage
 information.  The bit-width of an entry is determined by taking bytes 0 & 1 of the header (the output
 state variable width, multiplying this value by 2, and adding the number of entry supplemental bits
 for an entry (currently this value is 6).  Each entry is byte-aligned in the arc array.  The fields that
 comprise an entry are described below.

 \par
 <table>
   <tr> <th>Bits</th> <th>Description</th> </tr>
   <tr> <td> 0 </td> <td> Set to 1 if the forward bidirectional state transition was hit; otherwise, set to 0. </td> </tr>
   <tr> <td> 1 </td> <td> Set to 1 if the reverse bidirectional state transition was hit; otherwise, set to 0. </td> </tr>
   <tr> <td> 2 </td> <td> Set to 1 if this entry is bidirectional (reverse is a transition); otherwise, only forward is valid. </td> </tr>
   <tr> <td> 3 </td> <td> Set to 1 if the output state of the forward transition is a new state in the arc array. </td> </tr>
   <tr> <td> 4 </td> <td> Set to 1 if the input state of the forward transition is a new state in the arc array. </td> </tr>
   <tr> <td> 5 </td> <td> Set to 1 if the forward state transition is excluded from coverage. </td> </tr>
   <tr> <td> 6 </td> <td> Set to 1 if the reverse state transition is excluded from coverage. </td> </tr>
   <tr> <td> (width + 6):7 </td> <td> Bit value of output state of the forward transition. </td> </tr>
   <tr> <td> ((width * 2) + 6):(width + 7) </td> <td> Bit value of input state of the forward transition. </td> </tr>
 </table>

 \par Adding State Transitions
 When an state transition occurs during simulation, the arc array is searched to see if an entry already exists that
 contains the same state transition.  If no matching entry is found, a new entry is added to the existing arc array.
 If the arc array allocated is currently full (current allocated size in header equals the current number of used
 entries), the array is grown.  The number of entries that the array grows is equal to the bit width of the output
 state variable.  When the new state is added, the entry is stored as a "forward" entry.  A forward entry is an entry
 that contains the input state value in the upper bits of the entry and the output state value in the lower bits of
 the entry.  If the state is added prior to simulation, bit 0 (hit forward) of the entry is set to 0; otherwise, it
 is set to a value of 1, indicating that the forward version of the state transition was hit.  If a state transition
 is found in the array but the order of the input and output values are reversed from the stored entry, the entry
 is stored into the same entry, setting bit 2 (bidirectional entry bit) to a value of 1.  This indicates that the
 current entry contains a forward entry and a reverse entry (input state value is stored in lower order bits and
 output state value is stored in upper order bits of the entry).  If this type of entry is stored prior to simulation,
 bit 1 (reverse hit bit) is set to 0; otherwise, the bit is set to a value of 1.  The following example shows an arc
 array as state transitions are added to it during simulation.

 \par
 <table>
   <caption align=bottom>HF: Forward direction hit, HR: Reverse direction hit, BD: Entry is bidirectional</caption>
   <tr> <th>Event</th> <th colspan=3>Entry</th> <th>Action</th> </tr>
   <tr> <td></td> <td>0</td> <td>1</td> <td>2</td> </tr>
   <tr> <td>Add 0-&gt;1</td> <td>0-&gt;1,HF=1,HR=0,BD=0</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>0-&gt;1 not found in table, add as forward in entry 0</td> </tr>
   <tr> <td>Add 1-&gt;2</td> <td>0-&gt;1,HF=1,HR=0,BD=0</tr> <td>1-&gt;2,HF=1,HR=0,BD=0</td> <td></td> <td>1-&gt;2 not found in table, add as forward in entry 1</td> </tr>
   <tr> <td>Add 1-&gt;0</td> <td>0-&gt;1,HF=1,HR=1,BD=1</tr> <td>1-&gt;2,HF=1,HR=0,BD=0</td> <td></td> <td>1-&gt;0 found in entry 0, add as reverse and set bidirectional entry bit</td></tr>
 </table>

 \par Calculating FSM State Coverage Metrics
 To calculate the number of FSM states that are in an arc array, we first need to figure out what state values
 are unique in the arc array.  Since state transitions contain two state values (input and output), we need to
 compare each state whether it is an input or an output state to every other state value in the arc array.  To
 do this, we start with the input state (in the forward direction -- value in upper bits of entry) in entry 0
 and compare it to each and every state in the arc array.  If the current state value matches the first entry
 and the current state value is in the upper bits of the entry, bit 4 is set in the entry's supplemental field
 to indicate that its state is not unique.  If the current state value matches the first entry and the current
 state value is in the lower bits of the entry, bit 5 is set in the entry's supplemental field to indicate that
 its state is not unique.  If the current value does not match the first state value, nothing happens.  After
 all states have been compared, the right value (if bit 5 in its entry supplemental field is not set) is
 compared to all of the rest of the state values (if their bit 4 or bit 5 in their supplemental field is not
 already set) are compared.  This continues for all state values.  After the state comparing phase has occurred,
 we can simply walk through the arc array counting all of the states that do not have their corresponding bit 4
 or bit 5 set.

 \par Calculating FSM State Transition Coverage Metrics
 To calculate state transition coverage for the arc array is simple.  Just count the number of entries that have
 bit 0 set to 1 and bits 1 and 2 set to 1.  This will give you the number of state transitions that were hit
 during simulation.

 \par Outputting an Arc to a File
 Writing and reading an arc to and from a file is accomplished by writing each byte in the arc array to the file
 in hexidecimal format (zero-filling the output) with no spaces between the bytes.  Additionally, if a byte
 contains the hexidecimal value of 0x0, simply output a comma character (this saves one character in the file for
 each byte that contains a value of 0x0).  Keeping the output of an arc array to as small as possible in the file
 is necessary due to the large memory footprint that just one FSM can take.

 Updating e-mail address from trevorw@charter.net to phase1geo@gmail.com.

 Revision 1.40  2007/09/13 17:03:30  phase1geo
 Cleaning up some const-ness corrections -- still more to go but it's a good
 start.

 Revision 1.39  2006/10/12 22:48:45  phase1geo
 Updates to remove compiler warnings.  Still some work left to go here.

 Revision 1.38  2006/09/20 22:38:09  phase1geo
 Lots of changes to support memories and multi-dimensional arrays.  We still have
 issues with endianness and VCS regressions have not been run, but this is a significant
 amount of work that needs to be checkpointed.

 Revision 1.37  2006/06/29 22:44:57  phase1geo
 Fixing newly introduced bug in FSM report handler.  Also adding pointers back
 to main text window when exclusion properties are changed.  Fixing toggle
 coverage retension.  This is partially working but doesn't seem to want to
 save/restore properly at this point.

 Revision 1.36  2006/06/29 16:48:14  phase1geo
 FSM exclusion code now complete.

 Revision 1.35  2006/06/29 04:26:02  phase1geo
 More updates for FSM coverage.  We are getting close but are just not to fully
 working order yet.

 Revision 1.34  2006/06/28 22:15:19  phase1geo
 Adding more code to support FSM coverage.  Still a ways to go before this
 is completed.

 Revision 1.33  2006/06/23 19:45:26  phase1geo
 Adding full C support for excluding/including coverage points.  Fixed regression
 suite failures -- full regression now passes.  We just need to start adding support
 to the Tcl/Tk files for full user-specified exclusion support.

 Revision 1.32  2006/06/22 21:56:21  phase1geo
 Adding excluded bits to signal and arc structures and changed statistic gathering
 functions to not gather coverage for excluded structures.  Started to work on
 exclude.c file which will quickly adjust coverage information from GUI modifications.
 Regression has been updated for this change and it fully passes.

 Revision 1.31  2006/04/05 15:19:18  phase1geo
 Adding support for FSM coverage output in the GUI.  Started adding components
 for assertion coverage to GUI and report functions though there is no functional
 support for this at this time.

 Revision 1.30  2006/03/28 22:28:27  phase1geo
 Updates to user guide and added copyright information to each source file in the
 src directory.  Added test directory in user documentation directory containing the
 example used in line, toggle, combinational logic and FSM descriptions.

 Revision 1.29  2006/03/27 23:25:30  phase1geo
 Updating development documentation for 0.4 stable release.

 Revision 1.28  2006/02/02 22:37:40  phase1geo
 Starting to put in support for signed values and inline register initialization.
 Also added support for more attribute locations in code.  Regression updated for
 these changes.  Interestingly, with the changes that were made to the parser,
 signals are output to reports in order (before they were completely reversed).
 This is a nice surprise...  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.27  2005/12/21 22:30:54  phase1geo
 More updates to memory leak fix list.  We are getting close!  Added some helper
 scripts/rules to more easily debug valgrind memory leak errors.  Also added suppression
 file for valgrind for a memory leak problem that exists in lex-generated code.

 Revision 1.26  2005/02/05 04:13:27  phase1geo
 Started to add reporting capabilities for race condition information.  Modified
 race condition reason calculation and handling.  Ran -Wall on all code and cleaned
 things up.  Cleaned up regression as a result of these changes.  Full regression
 now passes.

 Revision 1.25  2005/01/06 23:51:16  phase1geo
 Intermediate checkin.  Files don't fully compile yet.

 Revision 1.24  2004/04/05 12:30:52  phase1geo
 Adding *db_replace functions to allow a design to be opened with new CDD
 results (for GUI purposes only).

 Revision 1.23  2004/03/16 05:45:43  phase1geo
 Checkin contains a plethora of changes, bug fixes, enhancements...
 Some of which include:  new diagnostics to verify bug fixes found in field,
 test generator script for creating new diagnostics, enhancing error reporting
 output to include filename and line number of failing code (useful for error
 regression testing), support for error regression testing, bug fixes for
 segmentation fault errors found in field, additional data integrity features,
 and code support for GUI tool (this submission does not include TCL files).

 Revision 1.22  2004/03/15 21:38:17  phase1geo
 Updated source files after running lint on these files.  Full regression
 still passes at this point.

 Revision 1.21  2003/11/16 04:03:38  phase1geo
 Updating development documentation for FSMs.

 Revision 1.20  2003/11/10 04:25:50  phase1geo
 Adding more FSM diagnostics to regression suite.  All major testing for
 current FSM code should be complete at this time.  A few bug fixes to files
 that were found during this regression testing.

 Revision 1.19  2003/11/08 04:21:26  phase1geo
 Adding several new FSM diagnostics to regression suite to verify inline
 attributes.  Fixed bug in arc.c where states were not being identified
 correctly as unique or not.

 Revision 1.18  2003/11/08 03:38:50  phase1geo
 Adding new FSM diagnostics to regression suite and fixing problem that was causing
 regressions to fail.

 Revision 1.17  2003/11/07 05:18:40  phase1geo

 at this point but the code seems to be working correctly.

 Revision 1.16  2003/10/28 13:28:00  phase1geo
 Updates for more FSM attribute handling.  Not quite there yet but full regression
 still passes.

 Revision 1.15  2003/10/17 12:55:36  phase1geo
 Intermediate checkin for LSB fixes.

 Revision 1.14  2003/10/16 12:27:19  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in arc.c related to non-zero LSBs.

 Revision 1.13  2003/09/19 18:04:28  phase1geo
 Adding fsm3 diagnostic to check proper handling of wide state variables.
 Code fixes to support new diagnostic.

 Revision 1.12  2003/09/19 13:25:28  phase1geo
 Adding new FSM diagnostics including diagnostics to verify FSM merging function.
 FSM merging code was modified to work correctly.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.11  2003/09/19 02:34:51  phase1geo
 Added new fsm1.3 diagnostic to regress suite which found a bug in arc.c that is
 now fixed.  It had to do with resizing an arc array and copying its values.
 Additionally, some output was fixed in the FSM reports.

 Revision 1.10  2003/09/15 02:37:03  phase1geo
 Adding development documentation for functions that needed them.

 Revision 1.9  2003/09/15 01:13:57  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in vector_to_int() function when LSB is not 0.  Fixing
 bug in arc_state_to_string() function in creating string version of state.

 Revision 1.8  2003/09/14 01:09:20  phase1geo
 Added verbose output for FSMs.

 Revision 1.7  2003/09/13 19:53:59  phase1geo
 Adding correct way of calculating state and state transition totals.  Modifying
 FSM summary reporting to reflect these changes.  Also added function documentation
 that was missing from last submission.

 Revision 1.6  2003/09/13 06:05:12  phase1geo
 Adding code to properly count unique hit states.

 Revision 1.5  2003/09/13 02:59:34  phase1geo
 Fixing bugs in arc.c created by extending entry supplemental field to 5 bits
 from 3 bits.  Additional two bits added for calculating unique states.

 Revision 1.4  2003/09/12 04:47:00  phase1geo
 More fixes for new FSM arc transition protocol.  Everything seems to work now
 except that state hits are not being counted correctly.

 Revision 1.3  2003/08/29 12:52:06  phase1geo
 Updating comments for functions.

 Revision 1.2  2003/08/26 21:53:23  phase1geo
 Added database read/write functions and fixed problems with other arc functions.

 Revision 1.1  2003/08/26 12:53:35  phase1geo
 Added initial versions of arc.c and arc.h though they are not even close to
 being finished at this point.
