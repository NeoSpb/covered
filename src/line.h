 Revision 1.13  2006/03/28 22:28:27  phase1geo
 Updates to user guide and added copyright information to each source file in the
 src directory.  Added test directory in user documentation directory containing the
 example used in line, toggle, combinational logic and FSM descriptions.

 Revision 1.12  2005/11/10 19:28:23  phase1geo
 Updates/fixes for tasks/functions.  Also updated Tcl/Tk scripts for these changes.
 Fixed bug with net_decl_assign statements -- the line, start column and end column
 information was incorrect, causing problems with the GUI output.

 Revision 1.11  2005/11/08 23:12:09  phase1geo
 Fixes for function/task additions.  Still a lot of testing on these structures;
 however, regressions now pass again so we are checkpointing here.

 Revision 1.10  2004/03/16 05:45:43  phase1geo
 Checkin contains a plethora of changes, bug fixes, enhancements...
 Some of which include:  new diagnostics to verify bug fixes found in field,
 test generator script for creating new diagnostics, enhancing error reporting
 output to include filename and line number of failing code (useful for error
 regression testing), support for error regression testing, bug fixes for
 segmentation fault errors found in field, additional data integrity features,
 and code support for GUI tool (this submission does not include TCL files).

 Revision 1.9  2003/11/22 20:44:58  phase1geo
 Adding function to get array of missed line numbers for GUI purposes.  Updates
 to report command for getting information ready when running the GUI.

 Revision 1.8  2002/11/05 00:20:07  phase1geo
 Adding development documentation.  Fixing problem with combinational logic
 output in report command and updating full regression.

 Revision 1.7  2002/10/31 23:13:55  phase1geo
 Fixing C compatibility problems with cc and gcc.  Found a few possible problems
 with 64-bit vs. 32-bit compilation of the tool.  Fixed bug in parser that
 lead to bus errors.  Ran full regression in 64-bit mode without error.

 Revision 1.6  2002/10/29 19:57:50  phase1geo
 Fixing problems with beginning block comments within comments which are
 produced automatically by CVS.  Should fix warning messages from compiler.

 Revision 1.5  2002/09/13 05:12:25  phase1geo
 Adding final touches to -d option to report.  Adding documentation and
 updating development documentation to stay in sync.

 Revision 1.4  2002/06/25 21:46:10  phase1geo
 Fixes to simulator and reporting.  Still some bugs here.

 Revision 1.3  2002/05/13 03:02:58  phase1geo
 Adding lines back to expressions and removing them from statements (since the line
 number range of an expression can be calculated by looking at the expression line
 numbers).
