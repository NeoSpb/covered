 $Log$
 Revision 1.13.6.1  2008/07/10 22:43:54  phase1geo
 Merging in rank-devel-branch into this branch.  Added -f options for all commands
 to allow files containing command-line arguments to be added.  A few error diagnostics
 are currently failing due to changes in the rank branch that never got fixed in that
 branch.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.14  2008/06/27 14:02:04  phase1geo
 Fixing splint and -Wextra warnings.  Also fixing comment formatting.

 Revision 1.13  2008/01/10 04:59:04  phase1geo
 More splint updates.  All exportlocal cases are now taken care of.

 Revision 1.12  2007/11/20 05:28:59  phase1geo
 Updating e-mail address from trevorw@charter.net to phase1geo@gmail.com.

 Revision 1.11  2006/09/22 19:56:45  phase1geo
 Final set of fixes and regression updates per recent changes.  Full regression
 now passes.

 Revision 1.10  2006/09/20 22:38:09  phase1geo
 Lots of changes to support memories and multi-dimensional arrays.  We still have
 issues with endianness and VCS regressions have not been run, but this is a significant
 amount of work that needs to be checkpointed.

 Revision 1.9  2006/08/31 22:32:18  phase1geo
 Things are in a state of flux at the moment.  I have added proper parsing support
 for assertions, properties and sequences.  Also added partial support for the $root
 space (though I need to work on figuring out how to handle it in terms of the
 instance tree) and all that goes along with that.  Add parsing support with an
 error message for multi-dimensional array declarations.  Regressions should not be
 expected to run correctly at the moment.

 Revision 1.8  2006/07/15 22:07:14  phase1geo
 Added all code to parser to check generation value to decide if a piece of
 syntax is allowable by the parser or not.  This code compiles and has been
 proven to not break regressions; however, none if it has been tested at this
 point.  Many regression tests to follow...

 Revision 1.7  2006/03/28 22:28:27  phase1geo
 Updates to user guide and added copyright information to each source file in the
 src directory.  Added test directory in user documentation directory containing the
 example used in line, toggle, combinational logic and FSM descriptions.

 Revision 1.6  2006/02/01 19:58:28  phase1geo
 More updates to allow parsing of various parameter formats.  At this point
 I believe full parameter support is functional.  Regression has been updated
 which now completely passes.  A few new diagnostics have been added to the
 testsuite to verify additional functionality that is supported.
