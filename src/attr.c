 \par What is an attribute?
 An attribute is a Verilog-2001 syntatical feature that allows meta-comment-like information to
 be stored in a Verilog file which can be used by any tool that is capable of implementing its functionality.
 It uses the syntax (* ... *) which may be placed before just about any Verilog construct within a design.
 Covered is able to parse attributes, implementing its functionality for all Covered-defined attribute commands.
 Currently covered can parse the following attribute commands:

 \par
 -# \b covered_fsm - Allows FSM-specific coverage information to be embedded within a design file
 -# \b covered_assert - Allows assertion coverage information to be embedded within a design file

 $Log$
 Revision 1.14.4.1  2008/07/10 22:43:49  phase1geo
 Merging in rank-devel-branch into this branch.  Added -f options for all commands
 to allow files containing command-line arguments to be added.  A few error diagnostics
 are currently failing due to changes in the rank branch that never got fixed in that
 branch.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.15  2008/06/27 14:02:00  phase1geo
 Fixing splint and -Wextra warnings.  Also fixing comment formatting.

 Revision 1.14  2008/03/17 05:26:15  phase1geo
 Checkpointing.  Things don't compile at the moment.

 Revision 1.13  2008/03/14 22:00:17  phase1geo
 Beginning to instrument code for exception handling verification.  Still have
 a ways to go before we have anything that is self-checking at this point, though.

 Revision 1.12  2008/03/10 22:00:31  phase1geo
 Working on more exception handling (script is finished now).  Starting to work
 on code enhancements again :)  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.11  2008/03/04 06:46:47  phase1geo
 More exception handling updates.  Still work to go.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.10  2008/02/01 06:37:07  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in genprof.pl.  Added initial code for excluding final blocks and
 using pragma excludes (this code is not fully working yet).  More to be done.

 Revision 1.9  2007/12/10 23:16:21  phase1geo
 Working on adding profiler for use in finding performance issues.  Things don't compile
 at the moment.

 Revision 1.8  2007/11/20 05:28:57  phase1geo
 Updating e-mail address from trevorw@charter.net to phase1geo@gmail.com.

 Revision 1.7  2007/09/13 17:03:30  phase1geo
 Cleaning up some const-ness corrections -- still more to go but it's a good
 start.

 Revision 1.6  2006/04/05 15:19:18  phase1geo
 Adding support for FSM coverage output in the GUI.  Started adding components
 for assertion coverage to GUI and report functions though there is no functional
 support for this at this time.

 Revision 1.5  2006/03/28 22:28:27  phase1geo
 Updates to user guide and added copyright information to each source file in the
 src directory.  Added test directory in user documentation directory containing the
 example used in line, toggle, combinational logic and FSM descriptions.

 Revision 1.4  2006/03/27 23:25:30  phase1geo
 Updating development documentation for 0.4 stable release.

 Revision 1.3  2005/11/08 23:12:09  phase1geo
 Fixes for function/task additions.  Still a lot of testing on these structures;
 however, regressions now pass again so we are checkpointing here.

 Revision 1.2  2004/03/16 05:45:43  phase1geo
 Checkin contains a plethora of changes, bug fixes, enhancements...
 Some of which include:  new diagnostics to verify bug fixes found in field,
 test generator script for creating new diagnostics, enhancing error reporting
 output to include filename and line number of failing code (useful for error
 regression testing), support for error regression testing, bug fixes for
 segmentation fault errors found in field, additional data integrity features,
 and code support for GUI tool (this submission does not include TCL files).

 Revision 1.1  2003/10/28 00:18:05  phase1geo
 Adding initial support for inline attributes to specify FSMs.  Still more
 work to go but full regression still passes at this point.
