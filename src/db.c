 $Log$
 Revision 1.309.2.2  2008/07/25 21:08:35  phase1geo
 Modifying CDD file format to remove the potential for memory allocation assertion
 errors due to a large number of merged CDD files.  Updating IV and Cver regressions per this
 change.

 Revision 1.309.2.1  2008/07/10 22:43:50  phase1geo
 Merging in rank-devel-branch into this branch.  Added -f options for all commands
 to allow files containing command-line arguments to be added.  A few error diagnostics
 are currently failing due to changes in the rank branch that never got fixed in that
 branch.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.316.2.2  2008/07/02 23:10:37  phase1geo
 Checking in work on rank function and addition of -m option to score
 function.  Added new diagnostics to verify beginning functionality.
 Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.316.2.1  2008/07/01 06:17:21  phase1geo
 More updates to rank command.  Updating IV/Cver regression for these changes (full
 regression not passing at this point).  Checkpointing.

 Updating source files to optimize code when the --enable-debug option is specified.
 The performance was almost 8x worse with this option enabled, now it should be
 almost as good as without the mode (although, not completely).  Full regression
 passes.

 Revision 1.313  2008/06/20 18:12:54  phase1geo
 Adding a few more diagnostics to regressions.  Cleaning up check_test script
 to properly cleanup diagnostics that left CDD files around after regressions.

 pass.

 Revision 1.312  2008/06/19 16:14:54  phase1geo
 leaned up all warnings in source code from -Wall.  This also seems to have cleared
 up a few runtime issues.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.311  2008/06/17 23:03:28  phase1geo
 Fixing segmentation fault in db.c when a CDD file is found to be empty but the
 -D global option is specified.  Also enhancing the regression script environment.

 strip out the relative path information when performing CDD compares but pay
 attention to the rest of the score argument information.  Full regression
 passes.

 Revision 1.307.2.6  2008/05/28 05:57:10  phase1geo
 Updating code to use unsigned long instead of uint32.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.307.2.5  2008/05/26 05:42:09  phase1geo

 quite broken at the moment.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.305  2008/04/15 06:08:46  phase1geo
 First attempt to get both instance and module coverage calculatable for
 GUI purposes.  This is not quite complete at the moment though it does
 compile.

 Fixing several more memory issues and optimizing a bit of code per regression
 failures.  Full regression still does not pass but does complete (yeah!)
 Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.298  2008/03/22 02:21:07  phase1geo
 Checking in start of changes to properly handle the deallocation of vector
 memory from expressions.  Things are pretty broke at this point!

 Revision 1.297  2008/03/18 21:36:24  phase1geo
 Updates from regression runs.  Regressions still do not completely pass at
 this point.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.296  2008/03/17 22:02:30  phase1geo
 Adding new check_mem script and adding output to perform memory checking during
 regression runs.  Completed work on free_safe and added realloc_safe function
 calls.  Regressions are pretty broke at the moment.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.295  2008/03/17 05:26:15  phase1geo
 Checkpointing.  Things don't compile at the moment.

 Revision 1.294  2008/03/14 22:00:18  phase1geo
 Beginning to instrument code for exception handling verification.  Still have

 Revision 1.263  2007/12/10 23:16:21  phase1geo
 Working on adding profiler for use in finding performance issues.  Things don't compile
 at the moment.

 Revision 1.262  2007/11/20 05:28:57  phase1geo
 Updating e-mail address from trevorw@charter.net to phase1geo@gmail.com.

 Revision 1.261  2007/09/12 05:40:11  phase1geo
 Adding support for bool and char types in FOR loop initialization blocks.  Adding
 a plethora of new diagnostics to completely verify this new functionality.  These
 new diagnostics have not been run yet so they will fail in the next run of regression
 but should be ready to be checked out.

 Revision 1.260  2007/09/05 21:07:36  phase1geo
 Fixing bug 1788991.  Full regression passes.  Removed excess output used for
 debugging.  May want to create a new development release with these changes.

 Revision 1.259  2007/09/04 22:50:50  phase1geo
 Fixed static_afunc1 issues.  Reran regressions and updated necessary files.
 Also working on debugging one remaining issue with mem1.v (not solved yet).

 Revision 1.258  2007/08/31 22:46:36  phase1geo
 Adding diagnostics from stable branch.  Fixing a few minor bugs and in progress
 of working on static_afunc1 failure (still not quite there yet).  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.257  2007/07/26 22:23:00  phase1geo
 Starting to work on the functionality for automatic tasks/functions.  Just
 checkpointing some work.

 Revision 1.256  2007/07/24 22:52:26  phase1geo
 More clean-up for VCS regressions.  Still not fully passing yet.

 Revision 1.255  2007/07/18 22:39:17  phase1geo
 Checkpointing generate work though we are at a fairly broken state at the moment.

 Revision 1.254  2007/07/18 02:15:04  phase1geo
 Attempts to fix a problem with generating instances with hierarchy.  Also fixing
 an issue with named blocks in generate statements.  Still some work to go before
 regressions are passing again, however.

 Revision 1.253  2007/07/16 18:39:59  phase1geo
 Finishing adding accumulated coverage output to report files.  Also fixed
 compiler warnings with static values in C code that are inputs to 64-bit
 variables.  Full regression was not run with these changes due to pre-existing
 simulator problems in core code.

 Revision 1.252  2007/04/03 04:15:17  phase1geo
 Fixing bugs in func_iter functionality.  Modified functional unit name
 flattening function (though this does not appear to be working correctly
 at this time).  Added calls to funit_flatten_name in all of the reporting
 files.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.251  2007/04/02 04:50:04  phase1geo
 Adding func_iter files to iterate through a functional unit for reporting
 purposes.  Updated affected files.

 Revision 1.250  2007/03/30 22:43:13  phase1geo
 Regression fixes.  Still have a ways to go but we are getting close.

 Revision 1.249  2007/03/19 22:52:50  phase1geo
 Attempting to fix problem with line ordering for a named block that is
 in the middle of another statement block.  Also fixed a problem with FORK
 expressions not being bound early enough.  Run currently segfaults but
 I need to checkpoint at the moment.

 Revision 1.248  2007/03/16 21:41:08  phase1geo
 Checkpointing some work in fixing regressions for unnamed scope additions.
 Getting closer but still need to properly handle the removal of functional units.

 Revision 1.247  2007/03/08 05:17:29  phase1geo
 Various code fixes.  Full regression does not yet pass.

 Revision 1.246  2006/12/23 04:44:45  phase1geo
 Fixing build problems on cygwin.  Fixing compile errors with VPI and fixing
 segmentation fault in the funit_converge function.  Regression is far from
 passing at this point.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.245  2006/12/19 06:06:05  phase1geo
 Shortening unnamed scope name from $unnamed_%d to $u%d.  Also fixed a few
 bugs in the instance_flatten function (still more debug work to go here).
 Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.244  2006/12/18 23:58:34  phase1geo
 Fixes for automatic tasks.  Added atask1 diagnostic to regression suite to verify.
 Other fixes to parser for blocks.  We need to add code to properly handle unnamed
 scopes now before regressions will get to a passing state.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.243  2006/12/15 17:33:45  phase1geo
 Updating TODO list.  Fixing more problems associated with handling re-entrant
 tasks/functions.  Still not quite there yet for simulation, but we are getting
 quite close now.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.242  2006/12/14 23:46:57  phase1geo
 Fixing remaining compile issues with support for functional unit pointers in
 expressions and unnamed scope handling.  Starting to debug run-time issues now.
 Added atask1 diagnostic to begin this verification process.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.241  2006/12/12 06:20:22  phase1geo
 More updates to support re-entrant tasks/functions.  Still working through
 compiler errors.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.240  2006/12/11 23:29:16  phase1geo
 Starting to add support for re-entrant tasks and functions.  Currently, compiling
 fails.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.239  2006/11/29 23:15:45  phase1geo
 Major overhaul to simulation engine by including an appropriate delay queue
 mechanism to handle simulation timing for delay operations.  Regression not
 fully passing at this moment but enough is working to checkpoint this work.

 Revision 1.238  2006/11/28 16:39:46  phase1geo
 More updates for regressions due to changes in delay handling.  Still work
 to go.

 Revision 1.237  2006/11/27 04:11:41  phase1geo
 Adding more changes to properly support thread time.  This is a work in progress
 and regression is currently broken for the moment.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.236  2006/11/25 21:29:01  phase1geo
 Adding timescale diagnostics to regression suite and fixing bugs in core associated
 with this code.  Full regression now passes for IV and Cver (not in VPI mode).

 Revision 1.235  2006/11/25 04:24:39  phase1geo
 Adding initial code to fully support the timescale directive and its usage.
 Added -vpi_ts score option to allow the user to specify a top-level timescale
 value for the generated VPI file (this code has not been tested at this point,
 however).  Also updated diagnostic Makefile to get the VPI shared object files
 from the current lib directory (instead of the checked in one).

 Revision 1.234  2006/11/22 20:20:01  phase1geo
 Updates to properly support 64-bit time.  Also starting to make changes to
 simulator to support "back simulation" for when the current simulation time
 has advanced out quite a bit of time and the simulator needs to catch up.
 This last feature is not quite working at the moment and regressions are
 currently broken.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.233  2006/11/21 19:54:13  phase1geo
 Making modifications to defines.h to help in creating appropriately sized types.
 Other changes to VPI code (but this is still broken at the moment).  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.232  2006/11/17 23:17:12  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in score command where parameter override values were not being saved
 off properly in the CDD file.  Also fixing bug when a parameter is found in a VCD
 file (ignoring its usage).  Updated regressions for these changes.

 Revision 1.231  2006/11/03 23:36:36  phase1geo
 Fixing bug 1590104.  Updating regressions per this change.

 Revision 1.230  2006/10/13 22:46:31  phase1geo
 Things are a bit of a mess at this point.  Adding generate12 diagnostic that
 shows a failure in properly handling generates of instances.

 Revision 1.229  2006/10/12 22:48:45  phase1geo
 Updates to remove compiler warnings.  Still some work left to go here.

 Revision 1.228  2006/10/09 17:54:19  phase1geo
 Fixing support for VPI to allow it to properly get linked to the simulator.
 Also fixed inconsistency in generate reports and updated appropriately in
 regressions for this change.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.227  2006/10/06 17:18:12  phase1geo
 Adding support for the final block type.  Added final1 diagnostic to regression
 suite.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.226  2006/09/25 22:22:28  phase1geo
 Adding more support for memory reporting to both score and report commands.
 We are getting closer; however, regressions are currently broken.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.225  2006/09/22 19:56:45  phase1geo
 Final set of fixes and regression updates per recent changes.  Full regression
 now passes.

 Revision 1.224  2006/09/20 22:38:09  phase1geo
 Lots of changes to support memories and multi-dimensional arrays.  We still have
 issues with endianness and VCS regressions have not been run, but this is a significant
 amount of work that needs to be checkpointed.

 Revision 1.223  2006/09/15 22:14:54  phase1geo
 Working on adding arrayed signals.  This is currently in progress and doesn't
 even compile at this point, much less work.  Checkpointing work.

 Revision 1.222  2006/09/11 22:27:55  phase1geo
 Starting to work on supporting bitwise coverage.  Moving bits around in supplemental
 fields to allow this to work.  Full regression has been updated for the current changes
 though this feature is still not fully implemented at this time.  Also added parsing support
 for SystemVerilog program blocks (ignored) and final blocks (not handled properly at this
 time).  Also added lexer support for the return, void, continue, break, final, program and
 endprogram SystemVerilog keywords.  Checkpointing work.

 Revision 1.221  2006/09/08 22:39:50  phase1geo
 Fixes for memory problems.

 Revision 1.220  2006/09/07 21:59:24  phase1geo
 Fixing some bugs related to statement block removal.  Also made some significant
 optimizations to this code.

 Revision 1.219  2006/09/05 21:00:44  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in removing statements that are generate items.  Also added parsing
 support for multi-dimensional array accessing (no functionality here to support
 these, however).  Fixing bug in race condition checker for generated items.
 Currently hitting into problem with genvars used in SBIT_SEL or MBIT_SEL type
 expressions -- we are hitting into an assertion error in expression_operate_recursively.

 Revision 1.218  2006/09/01 23:06:02  phase1geo
 Fixing regressions per latest round of changes.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.217  2006/09/01 04:06:36  phase1geo
 Added code to support more than one instance tree.  Currently, I am seeing
 quite a few memory errors that are causing some major problems at the moment.
 Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.216  2006/08/31 22:32:17  phase1geo
 Things are in a state of flux at the moment.  I have added proper parsing support
 for assertions, properties and sequences.  Also added partial support for the $root
 space (though I need to work on figuring out how to handle it in terms of the
 instance tree) and all that goes along with that.  Add parsing support with an
 error message for multi-dimensional array declarations.  Regressions should not be
 expected to run correctly at the moment.

 Revision 1.215  2006/08/29 22:49:31  phase1geo
 Added enumeration support and partial support for typedefs.  Added enum1
 diagnostic to verify initial enumeration support.  Full regression has not
 been run at this point -- checkpointing.

 Revision 1.214  2006/08/29 02:51:33  phase1geo
 Adding enumeration parsing support to parser.  No functionality at this point, however.

 Revision 1.213  2006/08/28 22:28:28  phase1geo
 Fixing bug 1546059 to match stable branch.  Adding support for repeated delay
 expressions (i.e., a = repeat(2) @(b) c).  Fixing support for event delayed
 assignments (i.e., a = @(b) c).  Adding several new diagnostics to verify this
 new level of support and updating regressions for these changes.  Also added
 parser support for logic port types.

 Revision 1.212  2006/08/25 22:49:45  phase1geo
 Adding support for handling generated hierarchical names in signals that are outside
 of generate blocks.  Added support for op-and-assigns in generate for loops as well
 as normal for loops.  Added generate11.4 and for3 diagnostics to regression suite
 to verify this new behavior.  Full regressions have not been verified with these
 changes however.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.211  2006/08/20 03:20:59  phase1geo
 Adding support for +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=, <<<=, >>>=, ++
 and -- operators.  The op-and-assign operators are currently good for
 simulation and code generation purposes but still need work in the comb.c
 file for proper combinational logic underline and reporting support.  The
 increment and decrement operations should be fully supported with the exception
 of their use in FOR loops (I'm not sure if this is supported by SystemVerilog
 or not yet).  Also started adding support for delayed assignments; however, I
 need to rework this completely as it currently causes segfaults.  Added lots of
 new diagnostics to verify this new functionality and updated regression for
 these changes.  Full IV regression now passes.

 Revision 1.210  2006/08/18 22:07:44  phase1geo
 Integrating obfuscation into all user-viewable output.  Verified that these
 changes have not made an impact on regressions.  Also improved performance
 impact of not obfuscating output.

 Revision 1.209  2006/08/15 16:21:53  phase1geo
 Fixing bug for generate4 diagnostic which incorrectly added a BIND element
 when not in a generate block.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.208  2006/08/11 15:16:48  phase1geo
 Joining slist3.3 diagnostic to latest development branch.  Adding changes to
 fix memory issues from bug 1535412.

 Revision 1.207  2006/08/10 22:35:14  phase1geo
 Updating with fixes for upcoming 0.4.7 stable release.  Updated regressions
 for this change.  Full regression still fails due to an unrelated issue.

 Revision 1.206  2006/08/02 22:28:31  phase1geo
 Attempting to fix the bug pulled out by generate11.v.  We are just having an issue
 with setting the assigned bit in a signal expression that contains a hierarchical reference
 using a genvar reference.  Adding generate11.1 diagnostic to verify a slightly different
 syntax style for the same code.  Note sure how badly I broke regression at this point.

 Revision 1.205  2006/08/01 04:38:20  phase1geo
 Fixing issues with binding to non-module scope and not binding references
 that reference a "no score" module.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.204  2006/07/31 22:11:07  phase1geo
 Fixing bug with generated tasks.  Added diagnostic to test generate functions
 (this is currently failing with a binding issue).

 Revision 1.203  2006/07/30 04:59:51  phase1geo
 Modifying db_find_signal to use scope lookup function (for upwards name
 referencing purposes).  Emits user error if specified signal could not be
 found (we are understanding that if the db_find_signal function is used, the
 signal better be within the current scope (no hierarchical referencing allowed).
 Diagnostic generate8.2 should work now with VCS.

 Revision 1.202  2006/07/29 21:15:08  phase1geo
 Fixing last issue with generate8.1.v.  Full regression passes with IV.  Still
 need to check VCS regression run.

 Revision 1.201  2006/07/29 20:53:42  phase1geo
 Fixing some code related to generate statements; however, generate8.1 is still
 not completely working at this point.  Full regression passes for IV.

 Revision 1.200  2006/07/27 16:27:16  phase1geo
 Adding diagnostics to verify basic generate case blocks.  Full regression
 passes.

 Revision 1.199  2006/07/27 16:08:46  phase1geo
 Fixing several memory leak bugs, cleaning up output and fixing regression
 bugs.  Full regression now passes (including all current generate diagnostics).

 Revision 1.198  2006/07/24 22:20:23  phase1geo
 Things are quite hosed at the moment -- trying to come up with a scheme to
 handle embedded hierarchy in generate blocks.  Chances are that a lot of
 things are currently broken at the moment.

 Revision 1.197  2006/07/21 22:39:00  phase1geo
 Started adding support for generated statements.  Still looks like I have
 some loose ends to tie here before I can call it good.  Added generate5
 diagnostic to regression suite -- this does not quite pass at this point, however.

 Revision 1.196  2006/07/21 17:47:09  phase1geo
 Simple if and if-else generate statements are now working.  Added diagnostics
 to regression suite to verify these.  More testing to follow.

 Revision 1.195  2006/07/21 05:47:42  phase1geo
 More code additions for generate functionality.  At this point, we seem to
 be creating proper generate item blocks and are creating the generate loop
 namespace appropriately.  However, the binder is still unable to find a signal
 created by a generate block.

 Revision 1.194  2006/07/20 20:11:08  phase1geo
 More work on generate statements.  Trying to figure out a methodology for
 handling namespaces.  Still a lot of work to go...

 Revision 1.193  2006/07/20 04:55:18  phase1geo
 More updates to support generate blocks.  We seem to be passing the parser
 stage now.  Getting segfaults in the generate_resolve code, presently.

 Revision 1.192  2006/07/19 22:30:45  phase1geo
 More work done for generate support.  Still have a ways to go.

 Revision 1.191  2006/07/18 21:52:49  phase1geo
 More work on generate blocks.  Currently working on assembling generate item
 statements in the parser.  Still a lot of work to go here.

 Revision 1.190  2006/07/17 22:12:42  phase1geo
 Adding more code for generate block support.  Still just adding code at this
 point -- hopefully I haven't broke anything that doesn't use generate blocks.

 Revision 1.189  2006/07/15 05:49:04  phase1geo
 Removed the old manstyle documentation directory as this tool is no longer
 used to generate user documentation.  Created new keywords files to break
 out 1995, 2001 and SystemVerilog syntax.  Added several new diagnostics
 to regression suite to verify this new feature (still more parser code to
 add to completely support this feature).  Also fixed several bugs that
 existed in the 0.4.5 stable release and added those tests.  Full regression
 is passing.  Finally, updated the manpage for the new -g option to the score
 command.  Still need to document this new option in the user's guide.  Added
 ability to verify the -g option diagnostics to the regression suite.

 Revision 1.188  2006/07/14 18:53:32  phase1geo
 Fixing -g option for keywords.  This seems to be working and I believe that
 regressions are passing here as well.

 Revision 1.187  2006/07/13 21:03:44  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in db_read function to set curr_funit to the correct structure
 when merging functional units.  Updated regressions per this fix.

 Revision 1.186  2006/07/12 22:16:18  phase1geo
 Fixing hierarchical referencing for instance arrays.  Also attempted to fix
 a problem found with unary1; however, the generated report coverage information
 does not look correct at this time.  Checkpointing what I have done for now.

 Revision 1.185  2006/07/11 02:32:47  phase1geo
 Fixing memory leak problem in db_close function (with score_args).

 Revision 1.184  2006/06/27 19:34:42  phase1geo
 Permanent fix for the CDD save feature.

 Revision 1.183  2006/05/28 02:43:49  phase1geo
 Integrating stable release 0.4.4 changes into main branch.  Updated regressions
 appropriately.

 Revision 1.182  2006/05/25 12:10:57  phase1geo
 Including bug fix from 0.4.4 stable release and updating regressions.

 Revision 1.181  2006/05/02 21:49:41  phase1geo
 Updating regression files -- all but three diagnostics pass (due to known problems).
 Added SCORE_ARGS line type to CDD format which stores the directory that the score
 command was executed from as well as the command-line arguments to the score
 command.

 Revision 1.180  2006/04/21 06:14:45  phase1geo
 Merged in changes from 0.4.3 stable release.  Updated all regression files
 for inclusion of OVL library.  More documentation updates for next development
 release (but there is more to go here).

 Revision 1.179  2006/04/19 22:21:33  phase1geo
 More updates to properly support assertion coverage.  Removing assertion modules
 from line, toggle, combinational logic, FSM and race condition output so that there
 won't be any overlap of information here.

 Revision 1.178  2006/04/18 21:59:54  phase1geo
 Adding support for environment variable substitution in configuration files passed
 to the score command.  Adding ovl.c/ovl.h files.  Working on support for assertion
 coverage in report command.  Still have a bit to go here yet.

 Revision 1.177  2006/04/14 17:05:13  phase1geo
 Reorganizing info line to make it more succinct and easier for future needs.
 Fixed problems with VPI library with recent merge changes.  Regression has
 been completely updated for these changes.

 Revision 1.176  2006/04/11 22:42:16  phase1geo
 First pass at adding multi-file merging.  Still need quite a bit of work here yet.

 Revision 1.175.4.1.4.1  2006/05/25 10:59:35  phase1geo
 Adding bug fix for hierarchically referencing parameters.  Added param13 and
 param13.1 diagnostics to verify this functionality.  Updated regressions.

 Revision 1.175.4.1  2006/04/20 21:55:16  phase1geo
 Adding support for big endian signals.  Added new endian1 diagnostic to regression
 suite to verify this new functionality.  Full regression passes.  We may want to do
 some more testing on variants of this before calling it ready for stable release 0.4.3.

 Revision 1.175  2006/03/28 22:28:27  phase1geo
 Updates to user guide and added copyright information to each source file in the
 src directory.  Added test directory in user documentation directory containing the
 example used in line, toggle, combinational logic and FSM descriptions.

 Revision 1.174  2006/02/16 21:19:26  phase1geo
 Adding support for arrays of instances.  Also fixing some memory problems for
 constant functions and fixed binding problems when hierarchical references are
 made to merged modules.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.173  2006/02/02 22:37:40  phase1geo
 Starting to put in support for signed values and inline register initialization.
 Also added support for more attribute locations in code.  Regression updated for
 these changes.  Interestingly, with the changes that were made to the parser,
 signals are output to reports in order (before they were completely reversed).
 This is a nice surprise...  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.172  2006/02/01 15:13:10  phase1geo
 Added support for handling bit selections in RHS parameter calculations.  New
 mbit_sel5.4 diagnostic added to verify this change.  Added the start of a
 regression utility that will eventually replace the old Makefile system.

 Revision 1.171  2006/01/31 16:41:00  phase1geo
 Adding initial support and diagnostics for the variable multi-bit select
 operators +: and -:.  More to come but full regression passes.

 Revision 1.170  2006/01/26 22:40:13  phase1geo
 Fixing last LXT bug.

 Revision 1.169  2006/01/25 16:51:27  phase1geo
 Fixing performance/output issue with hierarchical references.  Added support
 for hierarchical references to parser.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.168  2006/01/23 03:53:29  phase1geo
 Adding support for input/output ports of tasks/functions.  Regressions are not
 running cleanly at this point so there is still some work to do here.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.167  2006/01/20 22:44:51  phase1geo
 Moving parameter resolution to post-bind stage to allow static functions to
 be considered.  Regression passes without static function testing.  Static
 function support still has some work to go.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.166  2006/01/20 19:15:23  phase1geo
 Fixed bug to properly handle the scoping of parameters when parameters are created/used
 in non-module functional units.  Added param10*.v diagnostics to regression suite to
 verify the behavior is correct now.

 Revision 1.165  2006/01/19 23:10:38  phase1geo
 Adding line and starting column information to vsignal structure (and associated CDD
 files).  Regression has been fully updated for this change which now fully passes.  Final
 changes to summary GUI.  Fixed signal underlining for toggle coverage to work for both
 explicit and implicit signals.  Getting things ready for a preferences window.

 Revision 1.164  2006/01/16 17:27:41  phase1geo
 Fixing binding issues when designs have modules/tasks/functions that are either used
 more than once in a design or have the same name.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.163  2006/01/13 23:27:02  phase1geo
 Initial attempt to fix problem with handling functions/tasks/named blocks with
 the same name in the design.  Still have a few diagnostics failing in regressions
 to contend with.  Updating regression with these changes.

 Revision 1.162  2006/01/12 22:53:01  phase1geo
 Adding support for localparam construct.  Added tests to regression suite to
 verify correct functionality.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.161  2006/01/12 22:14:45  phase1geo
 Completed code for handling parameter value pass by name Verilog-2001 syntax.
 Added diagnostics to regression suite and updated regression files for this
 change.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.160  2006/01/10 23:13:50  phase1geo
 Completed support for implicit event sensitivity list.  Added diagnostics to verify
 this new capability.  Also started support for parsing inline parameters and port
 declarations (though this is probably not complete and not passing at this point).
 Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.159  2006/01/10 05:56:36  phase1geo
 In the middle of adding support for event sensitivity lists to score command.
 Regressions should pass but this code is not complete at this time.

 Revision 1.158  2006/01/05 05:52:06  phase1geo
 Removing wait bit in vector supplemental field and modifying algorithm to only
 assign in the post-sim location (pre-sim now is gone).  This fixes some issues
 with simulation results and increases performance a bit.  Updated regressions
 for these changes.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.157  2006/01/03 22:59:16  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in expression_assign function -- removed recursive assignment when
 the LHS expression is a signal, single-bit, multi-bit or static value (only
 recurse when the LHS is a CONCAT or LIST).  Fixing bug in db_close function to
 check if the instance tree has been populated before deallocating memory for it.
 Fixing bug in report help information when Tcl/Tk is not available.  Added bassign2
 diagnostic to regression suite to verify first described bug.

 Revision 1.156  2006/01/02 21:35:36  phase1geo
 Added simulation performance statistical information to end of score command
 when we are in debug mode.

 Revision 1.155  2005/12/17 05:47:36  phase1geo
 More memory fault fixes.  Regression runs cleanly and we have verified
 no memory faults up to define3.v.  Still have a ways to go.

 Revision 1.154  2005/12/14 23:03:24  phase1geo
 More updates to remove memory faults.  Still a work in progress but full
 regression passes.

 Revision 1.153  2005/12/13 23:15:14  phase1geo
 More fixes for memory leaks.  Regression fully passes at this point.

 Revision 1.152  2005/12/12 23:25:37  phase1geo
 Fixing memory faults.  This is a work in progress.

 Revision 1.151  2005/12/08 19:47:00  phase1geo
 Fixed repeat2 simulation issues.  Fixed statement_connect algorithm, removed the
 need for a separate set_stop function and reshuffled the positions of esuppl bits.
 Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.150  2005/12/07 20:23:38  phase1geo
 Fixing case where statement is unconnectable.  Full regression now passes.

 Added initial support for disable expression.  Added test to verify functionality.
 Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.148  2005/12/05 21:28:07  phase1geo
 Getting fork statements with scope to work.  Added test to regression to verify
 this functionality.  Fixed bug in binding expression to named block.

 Revision 1.147  2005/12/05 20:26:55  phase1geo
 Fixing bugs in code to remove statement blocks that are pointed to by expressions
 in NB_CALL and FORK cases.  Fixed bugs in fork code -- this is now working at the
 moment.  Updated regressions which now fully pass.

 Revision 1.146  2005/12/02 19:58:36  phase1geo
 Added initial support for FORK/JOIN expressions.  Code is not working correctly
 yet as we need to determine if a statement should be done in parallel or not.

 Revision 1.145  2005/12/02 12:03:17  phase1geo
 Adding support for excluding functions, tasks and named blocks.  Added tests
 to regression suite to verify this support.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.144  2005/12/01 21:11:16  phase1geo
 Adding more error checking diagnostics into regression suite.  Full regression
 passes.

 Revision 1.143  2005/12/01 20:49:02  phase1geo
 Adding nested_block3 to verify nested named blocks in tasks.  Fixed named block
 usage to be FUNC_CALL or TASK_CALL -like based on its placement.

 Revision 1.142  2005/12/01 16:08:19  phase1geo
 Allowing nested functional units within a module to get parsed and handled correctly.
 Added new nested_block1 diagnostic to test nested named blocks -- will add more tests
 later for different combinations.  Updated regression suite which now passes.

 Revision 1.141  2005/11/30 18:25:55  phase1geo
 Fixing named block code.  Full regression now passes.  Still more work to do on
 named blocks, however.

 Revision 1.140  2005/11/29 23:14:37  phase1geo
 Adding support for named blocks.  Still not working at this point but checkpointing
 anyways.  Added new task3.1 diagnostic to verify task removal when a task is calling
 another task.

 Revision 1.139  2005/11/29 19:04:47  phase1geo
 Adding tests to verify task functionality.  Updating failing tests and fixed
 bugs for context switch expressions at the end of a statement block, statement
 block removal for missing function/tasks and thread killing.

 Revision 1.138  2005/11/25 16:48:48  phase1geo
 Fixing bugs in binding algorithm.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.137  2005/11/23 23:05:24  phase1geo
 Updating regression files.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.136  2005/11/22 23:03:48  phase1geo
 Adding support for event trigger mechanism.  Regression is currently broke
 due to these changes -- we need to remove statement blocks that contain
 triggers that are not simulated.

 Revision 1.135  2005/11/21 04:17:43  phase1geo
 More updates to regression suite -- includes several bug fixes.  Also added --enable-debug
 facility to configuration file which will include or exclude debugging output from being
 generated.

 Revision 1.134  2005/11/18 23:52:55  phase1geo
 More regression cleanup -- still quite a few errors to handle here.

 Revision 1.133  2005/11/16 23:02:23  phase1geo
 Added new diagnostics to check for functions that contain time-consuming expressions (this
 is not allowed by Covered -- and not by most commercial simulators either).  Updated check_test
 to do error checking and added error outputs.  Full regression passes at this point -- 225 diagnostics.

 Revision 1.132  2005/11/16 22:01:51  phase1geo
 Fixing more problems related to simulation of function/task calls.  Regression
 runs are now running without errors.

 Revision 1.131  2005/11/15 23:08:02  phase1geo
 Updates for new binding scheme.  Binding occurs for all expressions, signals,
 FSMs, and functional units after parsing has completed or after database reading
 has been completed.  This should allow for any hierarchical reference or scope
 issues to be handled correctly.  Regression mostly passes but there are still
 a few failures at this point.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.130  2005/11/11 22:53:40  phase1geo
 Updated bind process to allow binding of structures from different hierarchies.
 Added task port signals to get added.

 Revision 1.129  2005/11/10 19:28:22  phase1geo
 Updates/fixes for tasks/functions.  Also updated Tcl/Tk scripts for these changes.
 Fixed bug with net_decl_assign statements -- the line, start column and end column
 information was incorrect, causing problems with the GUI output.

 Revision 1.128  2005/11/08 23:12:09  phase1geo
 Fixes for function/task additions.  Still a lot of testing on these structures;
 however, regressions now pass again so we are checkpointing here.

 Revision 1.127  2005/02/11 22:50:31  phase1geo
 Fixing bug with removing statement blocks that contain statements that cannot
 currently be handled by Covered correctly.  There was a problem when the bad statement
 was the last statement in the statement block.  Updated regression accordingly.
 Added race condition diagnostics that currently are not in regression due to lack
 of code support for them.  Ifdef'ed out the BASSIGN stuff for this checkin.

 Revision 1.126  2005/02/09 14:12:20  phase1geo
 More code for supporting expression assignments.

 Revision 1.125  2005/02/08 23:18:22  phase1geo
 Starting to add code to handle expression assignment for blocking assignments.
 At this point, regressions will probably still pass but new code isn't doing exactly
 what I want.

 Revision 1.124  2005/02/05 04:13:29  phase1geo
 Started to add reporting capabilities for race condition information.  Modified
 race condition reason calculation and handling.  Ran -Wall on all code and cleaned
 things up.  Cleaned up regression as a result of these changes.  Full regression
 now passes.

 Revision 1.123  2005/02/04 23:55:47  phase1geo
 Adding code to support race condition information in CDD files.  All code is
 now in place for writing/reading this data to/from the CDD file (although
 nothing is currently done with it and it is currently untested).

 Revision 1.122  2005/01/25 13:42:27  phase1geo
 Fixing segmentation fault problem with race condition checking.  Added race1.1
 to regression.  Removed unnecessary output statements from previous debugging
 checkins.

 Revision 1.121  2005/01/10 23:03:37  phase1geo
 Added code to properly report race conditions.  Added code to remove statement blocks
 from module when race conditions are found.

 Revision 1.120  2005/01/10 02:59:24  phase1geo
 Code added for race condition checking that checks for signals being assigned
 in multiple statements.  Working on handling bit selects -- this is in progress.

 Revision 1.119  2005/01/07 17:59:50  phase1geo
 Finalized updates for supplemental field changes.  Everything compiles and links
 correctly at this time; however, a regression run has not confirmed the changes.

 Revision 1.118  2004/12/20 04:12:00  phase1geo
 A bit more race condition checking code added.  Still not there yet.

 Revision 1.117  2004/12/18 16:23:16  phase1geo
 More race condition checking updates.

 Revision 1.116  2004/04/21 05:14:03  phase1geo
 Adding report_gui checking to print_output and adding error handler to TCL
 scripts.  Any errors occurring within the code will be propagated to the user.

 Revision 1.115  2004/04/19 04:54:55  phase1geo
 Adding first and last column information to expression and related code.  This is
 not working correctly yet.

 Adding replace and merge options to file menu.

 Revision 1.113  2004/04/07 11:36:03  phase1geo
 Changes made to allow opening multiple CDD files without needing to deallocate
 all memory for one before reallocating memory for another.  Things are not
 entirely working at this point.

 there yet, but we are getting close.

 Revision 1.101  2003/10/03 21:28:43  phase1geo
 Restructuring FSM handling to be better suited to handle new FSM input/output
 state variable allowances.  Regression should still pass but new FSM support
 is not supported.

 Revision 1.100  2003/09/22 03:46:24  phase1geo
 Adding support for single state variable FSMs.  Allow two different ways to
 specify FSMs on command-line.  Added diagnostics to verify new functionality.

 Revision 1.99  2003/09/12 04:47:00  phase1geo

 except that state hits are not being counted correctly.

 Revision 1.98  2003/08/25 13:02:03  phase1geo
 Initial stab at adding FSM support.  Contains summary reporting capability
 at this point and roughly works.  Updated regress suite as a result of these
 changes.

 Fixing bug with merging same DUTs from different testbenches.  Updated reports
 to display full path instead of instance name and parent instance name.  Added
 merge tests and added merge testing into regression test suite.  Fixing bug with
 -D/-Q option specified with merge command.  Full regression passing.

 Revision 1.88  2003/02/13 23:44:08  phase1geo
 Tentative fix for VCD file reading.  Not sure if it works correctly when
 original signal LSB is != 0.  Icarus Verilog testsuite passes.

 Revision 1.87  2003/02/12 14:56:22  phase1geo
 Adding info.c and info.h files to handle new general information line in

 fixed at this time.

 Revision 1.72  2002/12/05 14:45:17  phase1geo
 Removing assertion error from instance6.1 failure; however, this case does not
 work correctly according to instance6.2.v diagnostic.  Added @(...) output in
 report command for edge-triggered events.  Also fixed bug where a module could be
 parsed more than once.  Full regression does not pass at this point due to
 new instance6.2.v diagnostic.

 Revision 1.71  2002/12/03 14:25:24  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in db_add_statement function.  Not parsing FALSE path if the next_false

 Removing local user message allocation and replacing with global to help
 with memory efficiency.

 Revision 1.61  2002/10/11 04:24:01  phase1geo
 This checkin represents some major code renovation in the score command to
 fully accommodate parameter support.  All parameter support is in at this
 point and the most commonly used parameter usages have been verified.  Some
 bugs were fixed in handling default values of constants and expression tree
 resizing has been optimized to its fullest.  Full regression has been
 updated and passes.  Adding new diagnostics to test suite.  Fixed a few
 problems in report outputting.

 Revision 1.60  2002/10/01 13:21:24  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in report output for single and multi-bit selects.  Also modifying
 the way that parameters are dealt with to allow proper handling of run-time
 changing bit selects of parameter values.  Full regression passes again and
 all report generators have been updated for changes.

 Revision 1.59  2002/09/29 02:16:51  phase1geo
 Updates to parameter CDD files for changes affecting these.  Added support
 for bit-selecting parameters.  param4.v diagnostic added to verify proper
 support for this bit-selecting.  Full regression still passes.

 Revision 1.58  2002/09/25 02:51:44  phase1geo
 Removing need of vector nibble array allocation and deallocation during
 expression resizing for efficiency and bug reduction.  Other enhancements
 for parameter support.  Parameter stuff still not quite complete.

 Revision 1.57  2002/09/23 01:37:44  phase1geo
 Need to make some changes to the inst_parm structure and some associated
 functionality for efficiency purposes.  This checkin contains most of the
 changes to the parser (with the exception of signal sizing).

 Revision 1.56  2002/09/21 07:03:28  phase1geo
 Attached all parameter functions into db.c.  Just need to finish getting
 parser to correctly add override parameters.  Once this is complete, phase 3
 can start and will include regenerating expressions and signals before
 getting output to CDD file.

 Revision 1.55  2002/09/19 05:25:19  phase1geo
 Fixing incorrect simulation of static values and fixing reports generated
 from these static expressions.  Also includes some modifications for parameters
 though these changes are not useful at this point.

 Revision 1.54  2002/09/06 03:05:27  phase1geo
 Some ideas about handling parameters have been added to these files.  Added
 "Special Thanks" section in User's Guide for acknowledgements to people
 helping in project.

 Revision 1.53  2002/08/26 12:57:03  phase1geo
 In the middle of adding parameter support.  Intermediate checkin but does
 not break regressions at this point.

 Revision 1.52  2002/08/23 12:55:32  phase1geo
 Starting to make modifications for parameter support.  Added parameter source
 and header files, changed vector_from_string function to be more verbose
 and updated Makefiles for new param.h/.c files.

 Revision 1.51  2002/08/19 04:34:06  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in database reading code that dealt with merging modules.  Module
 merging is now performed in a more optimal way.  Full regression passes and
 own examples pass as well.

 Revision 1.50  2002/08/14 04:52:48  phase1geo
 Removing unnecessary calls to signal_dealloc function and fixing bug
 with signal_dealloc function.

 Revision 1.49  2002/07/23 12:56:22  phase1geo
 Fixing some memory overflow issues.  Still getting core dumps in some areas.

 Revision 1.48  2002/07/22 05:24:46  phase1geo
 Creating new VCD parser.  This should have performance benefits as well as
 have the ability to handle any problems that come up in parsing.

 Revision 1.47  2002/07/20 22:22:52  phase1geo
 Added ability to create implicit signals for local signals.  Added implicit1.v
 diagnostic to test for correctness.  Full regression passes.  Other tweaks to
 output information.

 Revision 1.46  2002/07/18 22:02:35  phase1geo
 In the middle of making improvements/fixes to the expression/signal
 binding phase.

 Revision 1.45  2002/07/18 05:50:45  phase1geo
 Fixes should be just about complete for instance depth problems now.  Diagnostics
 to help verify instance handling are added to regression.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.44  2002/07/18 02:33:23  phase1geo
 Fixed instantiation addition.  Multiple hierarchy instantiation trees should
 now work.

 Revision 1.43  2002/07/17 21:45:56  phase1geo
 Fixing case where `define does not set to a value.  Looking into problem
 with embedded instances (at least 3 deep).

 Revision 1.42  2002/07/17 00:13:57  phase1geo
 Added support for -e option and informally tested.

 Revision 1.41  2002/07/14 05:10:42  phase1geo
 Added support for signal concatenation in score and report commands.  Fixed
 bugs in this code (and multiplication).

 Revision 1.39  2002/07/13 05:35:52  phase1geo
 Cause warning message to be displayed for a signal found in the VCD dumpfile
 that is in a covered scope but is not part of the design.  It could be that
 the design and VCD file do not match.

 Revision 1.37  2002/07/12 04:53:29  phase1geo
 Removing counter code that was used for debugging infinite loops in code
 previously.

 Revision 1.36  2002/07/09 04:46:26  phase1geo
 Adding -D and -Q options to covered for outputting debug information or
 suppressing normal output entirely.  Updated generated documentation and
 modified Verilog diagnostic Makefile to use these new options.

 Revision 1.35  2002/07/09 03:24:48  phase1geo
 Various fixes for module instantiantion handling.  This now works.  Also
 modified report output for toggle, line and combinational information.
 Regression passes.

 Revision 1.34  2002/07/09 02:04:25  phase1geo
 Fixing segmentation fault error due to deallocating a module before we
 have completed using it.

 Revision 1.33  2002/07/08 19:02:10  phase1geo
 Adding -i option to properly handle modules specified for coverage that
 are instantiated within a design without needing to parse parent modules.

 Revision 1.32  2002/07/08 12:35:31  phase1geo
 Added initial support for library searching.  Code seems to be broken at the
 moment.

 Revision 1.31  2002/07/05 16:49:47  phase1geo
 Modified a lot of code this go around.  Fixed VCD reader to handle changes in
 the reverse order (last changes are stored instead of first for timestamp).
 Fixed problem with AEDGE operator to handle vector value changes correctly.
 Added casez2.v diagnostic to verify proper handling of casez with '?' characters.
 Full regression passes; however, the recent changes seem to have impacted
 performance -- need to look into this.

 Revision 1.30  2002/07/05 00:10:18  phase1geo
 Adding report support for case statements.  Everything outputs fine; however,
 I want to remove CASE, CASEX and CASEZ expressions from being reported since
 it causes redundant and misleading information to be displayed in the verbose
 reports.  New diagnostics to check CASE expressions have been added and pass.

 Revision 1.29  2002/07/04 23:10:12  phase1geo
 Added proper support for case, casex, and casez statements in score command.
 Report command still incorrect for these statement types.

 Revision 1.28  2002/07/03 21:30:52  phase1geo
 Fixed remaining issues with always statements.  Full regression is running
 error free at this point.  Regenerated documentation.  Added EOR expression
 operation to handle the or expression in event lists.

 Revision 1.27  2002/07/03 19:54:36  phase1geo
 Adding/fixing code to properly handle always blocks with the event control
 structures attached.  Added several new diagnostics to test this ability.
 always1.v is still failing but the rest are passing.

 Revision 1.26  2002/07/02 19:52:50  phase1geo
 Removing unecessary diagnostics.  Cleaning up extraneous output and
 generating new documentation from source.  Regression passes at the
 current time.

 Revision 1.25  2002/07/02 18:42:18  phase1geo
 Various bug fixes.  Added support for multiple signals sharing the same VCD
 symbol.  Changed conditional support to allow proper simulation results.
 Updated VCD parser to allow for symbols containing only alphanumeric characters.

 Revision 1.24  2002/07/01 15:10:42  phase1geo
 Fixing always loopbacks and setting stop bits correctly.  All verilog diagnostics
 seem to be passing with these fixes.

 Revision 1.23  2002/06/30 22:23:20  phase1geo
 Working on fixing looping in parser.  Statement connector needs to be revamped.

 Revision 1.22  2002/06/28 03:04:59  phase1geo
 Fixing more errors found by diagnostics.  Things are running pretty well at
 this point with current diagnostics.  Still some report output problems.

 Revision 1.21  2002/06/28 00:40:37  phase1geo
 Cleaning up extraneous output from debugging.

 Revision 1.20  2002/06/27 20:39:43  phase1geo
 Fixing scoring bugs as well as report bugs.  Things are starting to work
 fairly well now.  Added rest of support for delays.

 Revision 1.19  2002/06/27 12:36:47  phase1geo
 Fixing bugs with scoring.  I think I got it this time.

 Revision 1.18  2002/06/26 04:59:50  phase1geo
 Adding initial support for delays.  Support is not yet complete and is
 currently untested.

 Revision 1.17  2002/06/26 03:45:48  phase1geo
 Fixing more bugs in simulator and report functions.  About to add support
 for delay statements.

 Revision 1.16  2002/06/25 21:46:10  phase1geo
 Fixes to simulator and reporting.  Still some bugs here.

 Revision 1.15  2002/06/25 03:39:03  phase1geo
 Fixed initial scoring bugs.  We now generate a legal CDD file for reporting.
 Fixed some report bugs though there are still some remaining.

 Revision 1.14  2002/06/24 12:34:56  phase1geo
 Fixing the set of the STMT_HEAD and STMT_STOP bits.  We are getting close.

 Revision 1.13  2002/06/24 04:54:48  phase1geo
 More fixes and code additions to make statements work properly.  Still not
 there at this point.

 Revision 1.12  2002/06/22 21:08:23  phase1geo
 Added simulation engine and tied it to the db.c file.  Simulation engine is
 currently untested and will remain so until the parser is updated correctly
 for statements.  This will be the next step.

 Revision 1.11  2002/06/22 05:27:30  phase1geo
 Additional supporting code for simulation engine and statement support in
 parser.

 Revision 1.10  2002/05/13 03:02:58  phase1geo
 Adding lines back to expressions and removing them from statements (since the line
 number range of an expression can be calculated by looking at the expression line
 numbers).

 Revision 1.9  2002/05/03 03:39:36  phase1geo
 Removing all syntax errors due to addition of statements.  Added more statement
 support code.  Still have a ways to go before we can try anything.  Removed lines
 from expressions though we may want to consider putting these back for reporting
 purposes.

 Revision 1.8  2002/05/02 03:27:42  phase1geo
 Initial creation of statement structure and manipulation files.  Internals are
 still in a chaotic state.

 Revision 1.7  2002/04/30 05:04:25  phase1geo
 Added initial go-round of adding statement handling to parser.  Added simple
 Verilog test to check correct statement handling.  At this point there is a
 bug in the expression write function (we need to display statement trees in
 the proper order since they are unlike normal expression trees.)
