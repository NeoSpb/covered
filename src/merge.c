 Revision 1.46.2.1  2008/05/24 05:36:21  phase1geo
 Fixing bitwise coverage functionality and updating regression files.  Added
 new bitwise1 and err5.1 diagnostics to regression suite.  Removing output
 for uncovered exceptions in command-line parsers.

 Revision 1.46  2008/03/31 21:40:23  phase1geo
 Fixing several more memory issues and optimizing a bit of code per regression
 failures.  Full regression still does not pass but does complete (yeah!)
 Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.45  2008/03/31 18:39:08  phase1geo
 Fixing more regression issues related to latest code modifications.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.44  2008/03/17 22:02:31  phase1geo
 Adding new check_mem script and adding output to perform memory checking during
 regression runs.  Completed work on free_safe and added realloc_safe function
 calls.  Regressions are pretty broke at the moment.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.43  2008/03/17 05:26:16  phase1geo
 Checkpointing.  Things don't compile at the moment.

 Revision 1.42  2008/03/14 22:00:19  phase1geo
 Beginning to instrument code for exception handling verification.  Still have
 a ways to go before we have anything that is self-checking at this point, though.

 Revision 1.41  2008/03/11 22:06:48  phase1geo
 Finishing first round of exception handling code.

 Revision 1.40  2008/02/09 19:32:45  phase1geo
 Completed first round of modifications for using exception handler.  Regression
 passes with these changes.  Updated regressions per these changes.

 Revision 1.39  2008/02/08 23:58:07  phase1geo
 Starting to work on exception handling.  Much work to do here (things don't
 compile at the moment).

 Revision 1.38  2008/01/21 21:39:55  phase1geo
 Bug fix for bug 1876376.

 Revision 1.37  2008/01/16 23:10:31  phase1geo
 More splint updates.  Code is now warning/error free with current version
 of run_splint.  Still have regression issues to debug.

 Revision 1.36  2008/01/10 04:59:04  phase1geo
 More splint updates.  All exportlocal cases are now taken care of.

 Revision 1.35  2008/01/09 23:54:15  phase1geo
 More splint updates.

 Revision 1.34  2007/12/12 07:23:19  phase1geo
 More work on profiling.  I have now included the ability to get function runtimes.
 Still more work to do but everything is currently working at the moment.

 Revision 1.33  2007/12/11 05:48:25  phase1geo
 Fixing more compile errors with new code changes and adding more profiling.
 Still have a ways to go before we can compile cleanly again (next submission
 should do it).

 Revision 1.32  2007/11/20 05:28:59  phase1geo
 Updating e-mail address from trevorw@charter.net to phase1geo@gmail.com.

 Revision 1.31  2007/04/10 03:56:18  phase1geo
 Completing majority of code to support new simulation core.  Starting to debug
 this though we still have quite a ways to go here.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.30  2007/03/13 22:12:59  phase1geo
 Merging changes to covered-0_5-branch to fix bug 1678931.

 Revision 1.29.2.1  2007/03/13 22:05:10  phase1geo
 Fixing bug 1678931.  Updated regression.

 Revision 1.29  2006/10/12 22:48:46  phase1geo
 Updates to remove compiler warnings.  Still some work left to go here.

 Revision 1.28  2006/08/18 04:41:14  phase1geo
 Incorporating bug fixes 1538920 and 1541944.  Updated regressions.  Only
 event1.1 does not currently pass (this does not pass in the stable version
 yet either).

 Revision 1.27  2006/08/02 22:28:32  phase1geo
 Attempting to fix the bug pulled out by generate11.v.  We are just having an issue
 with setting the assigned bit in a signal expression that contains a hierarchical reference
 using a genvar reference.  Adding generate11.1 diagnostic to verify a slightly different
 syntax style for the same code.  Note sure how badly I broke regression at this point.

 Revision 1.26  2006/06/27 19:34:43  phase1geo
 Permanent fix for the CDD save feature.

 Revision 1.25  2006/04/12 21:22:51  phase1geo
 Fixing problems with multi-file merging.  This now seems to be working
 as needed.  We just need to document this new feature.

 Revision 1.24  2006/04/11 22:42:16  phase1geo
 First pass at adding multi-file merging.  Still need quite a bit of work here yet.

 Revision 1.23  2006/04/07 03:47:50  phase1geo
 Fixing run-time issues with VPI.  Things are running correctly now with IV.

 Revision 1.22  2006/01/06 23:39:10  phase1geo
 Started working on removing the need to simulate more than is necessary.  Things
 are pretty broken at this point, but all of the code should be in -- debugging.

 Revision 1.21  2006/01/02 21:35:36  phase1geo
 Added simulation performance statistical information to end of score command
 when we are in debug mode.

 Revision 1.20  2005/12/21 22:30:54  phase1geo
 More updates to memory leak fix list.  We are getting close!  Added some helper
 scripts/rules to more easily debug valgrind memory leak errors.  Also added suppression
 file for valgrind for a memory leak problem that exists in lex-generated code.

 Revision 1.19  2005/12/13 23:15:15  phase1geo
 More fixes for memory leaks.  Regression fully passes at this point.

 Revision 1.18  2005/11/16 05:50:12  phase1geo
 Fixing binding with merge command.

 Revision 1.17  2004/03/16 05:45:43  phase1geo
 Checkin contains a plethora of changes, bug fixes, enhancements...
 Some of which include:  new diagnostics to verify bug fixes found in field,
 test generator script for creating new diagnostics, enhancing error reporting
 output to include filename and line number of failing code (useful for error
 regression testing), support for error regression testing, bug fixes for
 segmentation fault errors found in field, additional data integrity features,
 and code support for GUI tool (this submission does not include TCL files).

 Revision 1.16  2004/01/31 18:58:43  phase1geo
 Finished reformatting of reports.  Fixed bug where merged reports with
 different leading hierarchies were outputting the leading hierarchy of one
 which lead to confusion when interpreting reports.  Also made modification
 to information line in CDD file for these cases.  Full regression runs clean
 with Icarus Verilog at this point.

 Revision 1.15  2004/01/04 04:52:03  phase1geo
 Updating ChangeLog and TODO files.  Adding merge information to INFO line
 of CDD files and outputting this information to the merged reports.  Adding
 starting and ending line information to modules and added function for GUI
 to retrieve this information.  Updating full regression.

 Revision 1.14  2003/08/10 03:50:10  phase1geo
 More development documentation updates.  All global variables are now
 documented correctly.  Also fixed some generated documentation warnings.
 Removed some unnecessary global variables.

 Revision 1.13  2003/02/17 22:47:20  phase1geo
 Fixing bug with merging same DUTs from different testbenches.  Updated reports
 to display full path instead of instance name and parent instance name.  Added
 merge tests and added merge testing into regression test suite.  Fixing bug with
 -D/-Q option specified with merge command.  Full regression passing.

 Revision 1.12  2003/02/11 05:20:52  phase1geo
 Fixing problems with merging constant/parameter vector values.  Also fixing
 bad output from merge command when the CDD files cannot be opened for reading.

 Revision 1.11  2002/11/05 00:20:07  phase1geo
 Adding development documentation.  Fixing problem with combinational logic
 output in report command and updating full regression.

 Revision 1.10  2002/11/02 16:16:20  phase1geo
 Cleaned up all compiler warnings in source and header files.

 Revision 1.9  2002/10/29 19:57:50  phase1geo
 Fixing problems with beginning block comments within comments which are
 produced automatically by CVS.  Should fix warning messages from compiler.

 Revision 1.8  2002/10/29 13:33:21  phase1geo
 Adding patches for 64-bit compatibility.  Reformatted parser.y for easier
 viewing (removed tabs).  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.7  2002/10/11 05:23:21  phase1geo
 Removing local user message allocation and replacing with global to help
 with memory efficiency.

 Revision 1.6  2002/07/09 04:46:26  phase1geo
 Adding -D and -Q options to covered for outputting debug information or
 suppressing normal output entirely.  Updated generated documentation and
 modified Verilog diagnostic Makefile to use these new options.

 Revision 1.5  2002/07/08 16:06:33  phase1geo
 Updating help information.

 Revision 1.4  2002/07/03 03:31:11  phase1geo
 Adding RCS Log strings in files that were missing them so that file version
 information is contained in every source and header file.  Reordering src
 Makefile to be alphabetical.  Adding mult1.v diagnostic to regression suite.
