 $Log$
 Revision 1.23.6.1  2008/07/10 22:43:51  phase1geo
 Merging in rank-devel-branch into this branch.  Added -f options for all commands
 to allow files containing command-line arguments to be added.  A few error diagnostics
 are currently failing due to changes in the rank branch that never got fixed in that
 branch.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.24  2008/06/19 16:14:55  phase1geo
 leaned up all warnings in source code from -Wall.  This also seems to have cleared
 up a few runtime issues.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.23  2008/01/30 05:51:50  phase1geo
 Fixing doxygen errors.  Updated parameter list syntax to make it more readable.

 Revision 1.22  2008/01/16 06:40:37  phase1geo
 More splint updates.

 Revision 1.21  2008/01/10 04:59:04  phase1geo
 More splint updates.  All exportlocal cases are now taken care of.

 Revision 1.20  2007/11/20 05:28:58  phase1geo
 Updating e-mail address from trevorw@charter.net to phase1geo@gmail.com.

 Revision 1.19  2007/08/31 22:46:36  phase1geo
 Adding diagnostics from stable branch.  Fixing a few minor bugs and in progress
 of working on static_afunc1 failure (still not quite there yet).  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.18  2006/10/06 22:45:57  phase1geo
 Added support for the wait() statement.  Added wait1 diagnostic to regression
 suite to verify its behavior.  Also added missing GPL license note at the top
 of several *.h and *.c files that are somewhat new.

 Revision 1.17  2006/09/20 22:38:09  phase1geo
 Lots of changes to support memories and multi-dimensional arrays.  We still have
 issues with endianness and VCS regressions have not been run, but this is a significant
 amount of work that needs to be checkpointed.

 Revision 1.16  2006/09/07 21:59:24  phase1geo
 Fixing some bugs related to statement block removal.  Also made some significant
 optimizations to this code.

 Revision 1.15  2006/09/05 21:00:45  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in removing statements that are generate items.  Also added parsing
 support for multi-dimensional array accessing (no functionality here to support
 these, however).  Fixing bug in race condition checker for generated items.
 Currently hitting into problem with genvars used in SBIT_SEL or MBIT_SEL type
 expressions -- we are hitting into an assertion error in expression_operate_recursively.

 Revision 1.14  2006/08/25 22:49:45  phase1geo
 Adding support for handling generated hierarchical names in signals that are outside
 of generate blocks.  Added support for op-and-assigns in generate for loops as well
 as normal for loops.  Added generate11.4 and for3 diagnostics to regression suite
 to verify this new behavior.  Full regressions have not been verified with these
 changes however.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.13  2006/08/14 04:19:56  phase1geo
 Fixing problem with generate11* diagnostics (generate variable used in
 signal name).  These tests pass now but full regression hasn't been verified
 at this point.

 Revision 1.12  2006/08/02 22:28:32  phase1geo
 Attempting to fix the bug pulled out by generate11.v.  We are just having an issue
 with setting the assigned bit in a signal expression that contains a hierarchical reference
 using a genvar reference.  Adding generate11.1 diagnostic to verify a slightly different
 syntax style for the same code.  Note sure how badly I broke regression at this point.

 Revision 1.11  2006/07/29 20:53:43  phase1geo
 Fixing some code related to generate statements; however, generate8.1 is still
 not completely working at this point.  Full regression passes for IV.

 Revision 1.10  2006/07/28 22:42:51  phase1geo
 Updates to support expression/signal binding for expressions within a generate
 block statement block.

 Revision 1.9  2006/07/25 21:35:54  phase1geo
 Fixing nested namespace problem with generate blocks.  Also adding support
 for using generate values in expressions.  Still not quite working correctly
 yet, but the format of the CDD file looks good as far as I can tell at this
 point.

 Revision 1.8  2006/07/24 22:20:23  phase1geo
 Things are quite hosed at the moment -- trying to come up with a scheme to
 handle embedded hierarchy in generate blocks.  Chances are that a lot of
 things are currently broken at the moment.

 Revision 1.7  2006/07/21 22:39:01  phase1geo
 Started adding support for generated statements.  Still looks like I have
 some loose ends to tie here before I can call it good.  Added generate5
 diagnostic to regression suite -- this does not quite pass at this point, however.

 Revision 1.6  2006/07/21 05:47:42  phase1geo
 More code additions for generate functionality.  At this point, we seem to
 be creating proper generate item blocks and are creating the generate loop
 namespace appropriately.  However, the binder is still unable to find a signal
 created by a generate block.

 Revision 1.5  2006/07/20 20:11:09  phase1geo
 More work on generate statements.  Trying to figure out a methodology for
 handling namespaces.  Still a lot of work to go...

 Revision 1.4  2006/07/20 04:55:18  phase1geo
 More updates to support generate blocks.  We seem to be passing the parser
 stage now.  Getting segfaults in the generate_resolve code, presently.

 Revision 1.3  2006/07/18 21:52:49  phase1geo
 More work on generate blocks.  Currently working on assembling generate item
 statements in the parser.  Still a lot of work to go here.

 Revision 1.2  2006/07/17 22:12:42  phase1geo
 Adding more code for generate block support.  Still just adding code at this
 point -- hopefully I haven't broke anything that doesn't use generate blocks.

 Revision 1.1  2006/07/10 22:37:14  phase1geo
 Missed the actual gen_item files in the last submission.
