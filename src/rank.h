 $Log$
 Revision 1.1.4.1  2008/07/10 22:43:54  phase1geo
 Merging in rank-devel-branch into this branch.  Added -f options for all commands
 to allow files containing command-line arguments to be added.  A few error diagnostics
 are currently failing due to changes in the rank branch that never got fixed in that
 branch.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.1.2.1  2008/06/30 13:14:22  phase1geo
 Starting to work on new 'rank' command.  Checkpointing.
