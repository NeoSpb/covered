 but I need to checkpoint for now.

 Revision 1.75  2007/07/30 20:36:14  phase1geo
 Fixing rest of issues pertaining to new implementation of function calls.
 Full regression passes (with the exception of afunc1 which we do not expect
 to pass with these changes as of yet).

 Revision 1.74  2007/07/26 22:23:00  phase1geo
 Starting to work on the functionality for automatic tasks/functions.  Just
 checkpointing some work.

 Revision 1.73  2007/07/26 20:12:45  phase1geo
 Fixing bug related to failure of hier1.1 diagnostic.  Placing functional unit
 scope in quotes for cases where backslashes are used in the scope names (requiring
 spaces in the names to escape the backslash).  Incrementing CDD version and
 regenerated all regression files.  Only atask1 is currently failing in regressions
 now.

 Revision 1.72  2007/07/26 17:05:15  phase1geo
 Fixing problem with static functions (vector data associated with expressions
 were not being allocated).  Regressions have been run.  Only two failures
 in total still to be fixed.

 Revamping simulator core again.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.70  2007/04/11 22:29:48  phase1geo
 Adding support for CLI to score command.  Still some work to go to get history
 stuff right.  Otherwise, it seems to be working.

 Fixing some more simulation issues.

 Revision 1.68  2007/04/10 03:56:18  phase1geo

 this though we still have quite a ways to go here.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.67  2007/04/09 22:47:53  phase1geo
 Starting to modify the simulation engine for performance purposes.  Code is
 not complete and is untested at this point.

 Revision 1.66  2007/04/03 18:55:57  phase1geo
 Fixing more bugs in reporting mechanisms for unnamed scopes.  Checking in more
 regression updates per these changes.  Checkpointing.

 flattening function (though this does not appear to be working correctly
 at this time).  Added calls to funit_flatten_name in all of the reporting
 files.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.64  2007/04/02 20:19:36  phase1geo

 Revision 1.61  2007/03/19 22:52:50  phase1geo
 Attempting to fix problem with line ordering for a named block that is
 in the middle of another statement block.  Also fixed a problem with FORK
 expressions not being bound early enough.  Run currently segfaults but
 I need to checkpoint at the moment.

 Revision 1.60  2007/03/19 20:30:31  phase1geo
 More fixes to report command for instance flattening.  This seems to be
 working now as far as I can tell.  Regressions still have about 8 diagnostics
 failing with report errors.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.59  2007/03/19 03:30:16  phase1geo
 More fixes to instance flattening algorithm.  Still much more work to do here.
 Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.58  2007/03/16 22:28:14  phase1geo
 Checkpointing again.  Still having quite a few issues with getting good coverage
 reports.  Fixing a few more problems that the exclude3 diagnostic complained
 about.

 Revision 1.57  2007/03/16 21:41:09  phase1geo
 Checkpointing some work in fixing regressions for unnamed scope additions.
 Getting closer but still need to properly handle the removal of functional units.

 Revision 1.56  2006/12/23 04:44:48  phase1geo
 Fixing build problems on cygwin.  Fixing compile errors with VPI and fixing
 segmentation fault in the funit_converge function.  Regression is far from
 passing at this point.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.55  2006/12/19 05:23:38  phase1geo
 Added initial code for handling instance flattening for unnamed scopes.  This
 is partially working at this point but still needs some debugging.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.54  2006/12/11 23:29:16  phase1geo
 Starting to add support for re-entrant tasks and functions.  Currently, compiling
 fails.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.53.2.1  2007/04/17 16:31:53  phase1geo
 Fixing bug 1698806 by rebinding a parameter signal to its list of expressions
 prior to writing the initial CDD file (elaboration phase).  Added param16
 diagnostic to regression suite to verify the fix.  Full regressions pass.

 Revision 1.53  2006/11/25 21:29:01  phase1geo
 Adding timescale diagnostics to regression suite and fixing bugs in core associated
 with this code.  Full regression now passes for IV and Cver (not in VPI mode).

 Revision 1.52  2006/11/25 04:24:40  phase1geo
 Adding initial code to fully support the timescale directive and its usage.
 Added -vpi_ts score option to allow the user to specify a top-level timescale
 value for the generated VPI file (this code has not been tested at this point,
 however).  Also updated diagnostic Makefile to get the VPI shared object files
 from the current lib directory (instead of the checked in one).

 Revision 1.51  2006/11/03 23:36:36  phase1geo
 Fixing bug 1590104.  Updating regressions per this change.

 Revision 1.50  2006/10/13 22:46:31  phase1geo

 shows a failure in properly handling generates of instances.

 Revision 1.49  2006/10/12 22:48:46  phase1geo
 Updates to remove compiler warnings.  Still some work left to go here.

 Revision 1.48  2006/10/09 17:54:19  phase1geo
 Fixing support for VPI to allow it to properly get linked to the simulator.
 Also fixed inconsistency in generate reports and updated appropriately in
 regressions for this change.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.47  2006/10/03 22:47:00  phase1geo
 Adding support for read coverage to memories.  Also added memory coverage as
 a report output for DIAGLIST diagnostics in regressions.  Fixed various bugs
 left in code from array changes and updated regressions for these changes.
 At this point, all IV diagnostics pass regressions.

 Revision 1.46  2006/09/22 19:56:45  phase1geo
 Final set of fixes and regression updates per recent changes.  Full regression
 now passes.

 Revision 1.45  2006/09/22 04:23:04  phase1geo
 More fixes to support new signal range structure.  Still don't have full
 regressions passing at the moment.

 Revision 1.44  2006/09/20 22:38:09  phase1geo
 Lots of changes to support memories and multi-dimensional arrays.  We still have
 issues with endianness and VCS regressions have not been run, but this is a significant
 amount of work that needs to be checkpointed.

 Revision 1.43  2006/09/07 21:59:24  phase1geo
 Fixing some bugs related to statement block removal.  Also made some significant
 optimizations to this code.

 Revision 1.42  2006/09/06 22:09:22  phase1geo
 Fixing bug with multiply-and-op operation.  Also fixing bug in gen_item_resolve
 function where an instance was incorrectly being placed into a new instance tree.
 Full regression passes with these changes.  Also removed verbose output.

 Revision 1.41  2006/09/01 23:06:02  phase1geo
 Fixing regressions per latest round of changes.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.40  2006/09/01 04:06:37  phase1geo
 Added code to support more than one instance tree.  Currently, I am seeing
 quite a few memory errors that are causing some major problems at the moment.
 Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.39  2006/08/29 22:49:31  phase1geo
 Added enumeration support and partial support for typedefs.  Added enum1
 diagnostic to verify initial enumeration support.  Full regression has not
 been run at this point -- checkpointing.

 Revision 1.38  2006/08/24 22:25:12  phase1geo
 Fixing issue with generate expressions within signal hierarchies.  Also added
 ability to parse implicit named and * port lists.  Added diagnostics to regressions
 to verify this new ability.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.37  2006/08/24 03:39:02  phase1geo
 Fixing some issues with new static_lexer/parser.  Working on debugging issue
 related to the generate variable mysteriously losing its vector data.

 Revision 1.36  2006/08/18 22:07:45  phase1geo
 Integrating obfuscation into all user-viewable output.  Verified that these
 changes have not made an impact on regressions.  Also improved performance
 impact of not obfuscating output.

 Revision 1.35  2006/08/14 04:19:56  phase1geo
 Fixing problem with generate11* diagnostics (generate variable used in
 signal name).  These tests pass now but full regression hasn't been verified
 at this point.

 Revision 1.34  2006/08/02 22:28:32  phase1geo
 Attempting to fix the bug pulled out by generate11.v.  We are just having an issue
 with setting the assigned bit in a signal expression that contains a hierarchical reference
 using a genvar reference.  Adding generate11.1 diagnostic to verify a slightly different
 syntax style for the same code.  Note sure how badly I broke regression at this point.

 Revision 1.33  2006/08/01 18:05:13  phase1geo
 Adding more diagnostics to test generate item structure connectivity.  Fixing
 bug in funit_find_signal function to search the function (instead of the instance
 for for finding a signal to bind).

 Revision 1.32  2006/08/01 04:38:20  phase1geo
 Fixing issues with binding to non-module scope and not binding references
 that reference a "no score" module.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.31  2006/07/28 22:42:51  phase1geo
 Updates to support expression/signal binding for expressions within a generate
 block statement block.

 Revision 1.30  2006/07/28 16:30:53  phase1geo

 Revision 1.29  2006/07/27 16:08:46  phase1geo
 Fixing several memory leak bugs, cleaning up output and fixing regression
 bugs.  Full regression now passes (including all current generate diagnostics).

 Revision 1.28  2006/07/27 02:14:52  phase1geo
 Cleaning up verbose output and fixing a few bugs for regression.  IV
 regression passes at this point.

 Revision 1.27  2006/07/27 02:04:30  phase1geo
 Fixing problem with parameter usage in a generate block for signal sizing.

 Revision 1.26  2006/07/26 06:22:27  phase1geo
 Fixing rest of issues with generate6 diagnostic.  Still need to know if I
 have broken regressions or not and there are plenty of cases in this area
 to test before I call things good.

 Revision 1.25  2006/07/25 21:35:54  phase1geo
 Fixing nested namespace problem with generate blocks.  Also adding support
 for using generate values in expressions.  Still not quite working correctly
 yet, but the format of the CDD file looks good as far as I can tell at this
 point.

 Revision 1.24  2006/07/24 22:20:23  phase1geo
 Things are quite hosed at the moment -- trying to come up with a scheme to
 handle embedded hierarchy in generate blocks.  Chances are that a lot of
 things are currently broken at the moment.

 Revision 1.23  2006/07/21 22:39:01  phase1geo
 Started adding support for generated statements.  Still looks like I have
 some loose ends to tie here before I can call it good.  Added generate5
 diagnostic to regression suite -- this does not quite pass at this point, however.

 Revision 1.22  2006/07/21 15:52:41  phase1geo
 Checking in an initial working version of the generate structure.  Diagnostic
 generate1 passes.  Still a lot of work to go before we fully support generate
 statements, but this marks a working version to enhance on.  Full regression
 passes as well.

 Revision 1.21  2006/07/18 21:52:49  phase1geo
 More work on generate blocks.  Currently working on assembling generate item
 statements in the parser.  Still a lot of work to go here.

 Revision 1.20  2006/07/17 22:12:42  phase1geo
 Adding more code for generate block support.  Still just adding code at this
 point -- hopefully I haven't broke anything that doesn't use generate blocks.

 Revision 1.19  2006/06/27 19:34:42  phase1geo
 Permanent fix for the CDD save feature.

 Revision 1.18  2006/03/28 22:28:27  phase1geo
 Updates to user guide and added copyright information to each source file in the
 src directory.  Added test directory in user documentation directory containing the
 example used in line, toggle, combinational logic and FSM descriptions.

 Revision 1.17  2006/03/27 23:25:30  phase1geo
 Updating development documentation for 0.4 stable release.

 Revision 1.16  2006/02/01 15:13:11  phase1geo
 Added support for handling bit selections in RHS parameter calculations.  New
 mbit_sel5.4 diagnostic added to verify this change.  Added the start of a
 regression utility that will eventually replace the old Makefile system.

 Revision 1.15  2006/01/24 23:24:37  phase1geo
 More updates to handle static functions properly.  I have redone quite a bit
 of code here which has regressions pretty broke at the moment.  More work
 to do but I'm checkpointing.

 Revision 1.14  2006/01/23 03:53:30  phase1geo
 Adding support for input/output ports of tasks/functions.  Regressions are not
 running cleanly at this point so there is still some work to do here.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.13  2006/01/20 19:15:23  phase1geo
 Fixed bug to properly handle the scoping of parameters when parameters are created/used
 in non-module functional units.  Added param10*.v diagnostics to regression suite to
 verify the behavior is correct now.

 Revision 1.12  2006/01/13 23:27:02  phase1geo
 Initial attempt to fix problem with handling functions/tasks/named blocks with
 the same name in the design.  Still have a few diagnostics failing in regressions
 to contend with.  Updating regression with these changes.

 Revision 1.11  2005/12/22 23:04:42  phase1geo
 More memory leak fixes.

 Revision 1.10  2005/12/19 23:11:27  phase1geo
 More fixes for memory faults.  Full regression passes.  Errors have now been
 eliminated from regression -- just left-over memory issues remain.

 Revision 1.9  2005/12/14 23:03:24  phase1geo
 More updates to remove memory faults.  Still a work in progress but full
 regression passes.

 Revision 1.8  2005/12/12 23:25:37  phase1geo
 Fixing memory faults.  This is a work in progress.

 Revision 1.7  2005/12/01 21:11:16  phase1geo
 Adding more error checking diagnostics into regression suite.  Full regression
 passes.

 Revision 1.6  2005/12/01 20:49:02  phase1geo
 Adding nested_block3 to verify nested named blocks in tasks.  Fixed named block
 usage to be FUNC_CALL or TASK_CALL -like based on its placement.

 Revision 1.5  2005/12/01 16:08:19  phase1geo
 Allowing nested functional units within a module to get parsed and handled correctly.
 Added new nested_block1 diagnostic to test nested named blocks -- will add more tests
 later for different combinations.  Updated regression suite which now passes.

 Revision 1.4  2005/11/21 04:17:43  phase1geo
 More updates to regression suite -- includes several bug fixes.  Also added --enable-debug
 facility to configuration file which will include or exclude debugging output from being
 generated.

 Revision 1.3  2005/11/16 22:01:51  phase1geo
 Fixing more problems related to simulation of function/task calls.  Regression
 runs are now running without errors.

 Revision 1.2  2005/11/15 23:08:02  phase1geo
 Updates for new binding scheme.  Binding occurs for all expressions, signals,
 FSMs, and functional units after parsing has completed or after database reading
 has been completed.  This should allow for any hierarchical reference or scope
 issues to be handled correctly.  Regression mostly passes but there are still
 a few failures at this point.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.1  2005/11/08 23:12:09  phase1geo
 Fixes for function/task additions.  Still a lot of testing on these structures;
 however, regressions now pass again so we are checkpointing here.

 Revision 1.38  2005/02/05 04:13:30  phase1geo
 Started to add reporting capabilities for race condition information.  Modified
 race condition reason calculation and handling.  Ran -Wall on all code and cleaned
 things up.  Cleaned up regression as a result of these changes.  Full regression
 now passes.

 Revision 1.37  2005/02/04 23:55:53  phase1geo
 Adding code to support race condition information in CDD files.  All code is
 now in place for writing/reading this data to/from the CDD file (although
 nothing is currently done with it and it is currently untested).

 Revision 1.36  2005/01/07 17:59:52  phase1geo
 Finalized updates for supplemental field changes.  Everything compiles and links
 correctly at this time; however, a regression run has not confirmed the changes.

 Revision 1.35  2004/04/05 12:30:52  phase1geo
 Adding *db_replace functions to allow a design to be opened with new CDD
 results (for GUI purposes only).

 Revision 1.34  2004/03/30 15:42:14  phase1geo
 Renaming signal type to vsignal type to eliminate compilation problems on systems
 that contain a signal type in the OS.

 Revision 1.33  2004/03/16 05:45:43  phase1geo
 Checkin contains a plethora of changes, bug fixes, enhancements...
 Some of which include:  new diagnostics to verify bug fixes found in field,
 test generator script for creating new diagnostics, enhancing error reporting
 output to include filename and line number of failing code (useful for error
 regression testing), support for error regression testing, bug fixes for
 segmentation fault errors found in field, additional data integrity features,
 and code support for GUI tool (this submission does not include TCL files).

 Revision 1.32  2004/01/08 23:24:41  phase1geo
 Removing unnecessary scope information from signals, expressions and
 statements to reduce file sizes of CDDs and slightly speeds up fscanf
 function calls.  Updated regression for this fix.

 Revision 1.31  2004/01/04 04:52:03  phase1geo
 Updating ChangeLog and TODO files.  Adding merge information to INFO line
 of CDD files and outputting this information to the merged reports.  Adding
 starting and ending line information to modules and added function for GUI
 to retrieve this information.  Updating full regression.

 Revision 1.30  2003/08/25 13:02:04  phase1geo
 Initial stab at adding FSM support.  Contains summary reporting capability
 at this point and roughly works.  Updated regress suite as a result of these
 changes.

 Revision 1.29  2003/08/05 20:25:05  phase1geo
 Fixing non-blocking bug and updating regression files according to the fix.
 Also added function vector_is_unknown() which can be called before making
 a call to vector_to_int() which will eleviate any X/Z-values causing problems
 with this conversion.  Additionally, the real1.1 regression report files were
 updated.

 Revision 1.28  2002/12/30 05:31:33  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in module merge for reports when parameterized modules are merged.
 These modules should not output an error to the user when mismatching modules
 are found.

 Revision 1.27  2002/11/05 00:20:07  phase1geo
 Adding development documentation.  Fixing problem with combinational logic
 output in report command and updating full regression.

 Revision 1.26  2002/11/02 16:16:20  phase1geo
 Cleaned up all compiler warnings in source and header files.

 Revision 1.25  2002/10/31 23:13:57  phase1geo
 Fixing C compatibility problems with cc and gcc.  Found a few possible problems
 with 64-bit vs. 32-bit compilation of the tool.  Fixed bug in parser that
 lead to bus errors.  Ran full regression in 64-bit mode without error.

 Revision 1.24  2002/10/29 19:57:50  phase1geo
 Fixing problems with beginning block comments within comments which are
 produced automatically by CVS.  Should fix warning messages from compiler.

 Revision 1.23  2002/10/25 13:43:49  phase1geo
 Adding statement iterators for moving in both directions in a list with a single
 pointer (two-way).  This allows us to reverse statement lists without additional
 memory and time (very efficient).  Full regression passes and TODO list items
 2 and 3 are completed.

 Revision 1.22  2002/10/23 03:39:07  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in MBIT_SEL expressions to calculate the expression widths
 correctly.  Updated diagnostic testsuite and added diagnostic that
 found the original bug.  A few documentation updates.

 Revision 1.21  2002/10/11 05:23:21  phase1geo
 Removing local user message allocation and replacing with global to help
 with memory efficiency.

 Revision 1.20  2002/10/11 04:24:02  phase1geo
 This checkin represents some major code renovation in the score command to
 fully accommodate parameter support.  All parameter support is in at this
 point and the most commonly used parameter usages have been verified.  Some
 bugs were fixed in handling default values of constants and expression tree
 resizing has been optimized to its fullest.  Full regression has been
 updated and passes.  Adding new diagnostics to test suite.  Fixed a few
 problems in report outputting.

 Revision 1.19  2002/10/01 13:21:25  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in report output for single and multi-bit selects.  Also modifying
 the way that parameters are dealt with to allow proper handling of run-time
 changing bit selects of parameter values.  Full regression passes again and
 all report generators have been updated for changes.

 Revision 1.18  2002/09/29 02:16:51  phase1geo
 Updates to parameter CDD files for changes affecting these.  Added support
 for bit-selecting parameters.  param4.v diagnostic added to verify proper
 support for this bit-selecting.  Full regression still passes.

 Revision 1.17  2002/09/26 13:43:45  phase1geo
 Making code adjustments to correctly support parameter overriding.  Added
 parameter tests to verify supported functionality.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.16  2002/09/25 05:38:11  phase1geo
 Cleaning things up a bit.

 Revision 1.15  2002/09/25 05:36:08  phase1geo
 Initial version of parameter support is now in place.  Parameters work on a
 basic level.  param1.v tests this basic functionality and param1.cdd contains
 the correct CDD output from handling parameters in this file.  Yeah!

 Revision 1.13  2002/08/26 12:57:04  phase1geo
 In the middle of adding parameter support.  Intermediate checkin but does
 not break regressions at this point.

 Revision 1.12  2002/08/19 04:34:07  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in database reading code that dealt with merging modules.  Module
 merging is now performed in a more optimal way.  Full regression passes and
 own examples pass as well.

 Revision 1.11  2002/07/23 12:56:22  phase1geo
 Fixing some memory overflow issues.  Still getting core dumps in some areas.

 Revision 1.10  2002/07/20 18:46:38  phase1geo
 Causing fully covered modules to not be output in reports.  Adding
 instance3.v diagnostic to verify this works correctly.

 Revision 1.9  2002/07/18 02:33:24  phase1geo
 Fixed instantiation addition.  Multiple hierarchy instantiation trees should
 now work.

 Revision 1.8  2002/07/14 05:10:42  phase1geo
 Added support for signal concatenation in score and report commands.  Fixed
 bugs in this code (and multiplication).

 Revision 1.7  2002/07/09 04:46:26  phase1geo
 Adding -D and -Q options to covered for outputting debug information or
 suppressing normal output entirely.  Updated generated documentation and
 modified Verilog diagnostic Makefile to use these new options.

 Revision 1.6  2002/06/26 03:45:48  phase1geo
 Fixing more bugs in simulator and report functions.  About to add support
 for delay statements.

 Revision 1.5  2002/06/25 02:02:04  phase1geo
 Fixing bugs with writing/reading statements and with parsing design with
 statements.  We now get to the scoring section.  Some problems here at
 the moment with the simulator.

 Revision 1.4  2002/06/24 04:54:48  phase1geo
 More fixes and code additions to make statements work properly.  Still not
 there at this point.

 Revision 1.3  2002/05/02 03:27:42  phase1geo
 Initial creation of statement structure and manipulation files.  Internals are
 still in a chaotic state.
