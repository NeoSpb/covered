 $Log$
 Revision 1.95.4.1  2008/07/10 22:43:52  phase1geo
 Merging in rank-devel-branch into this branch.  Added -f options for all commands
 to allow files containing command-line arguments to be added.  A few error diagnostics
 are currently failing due to changes in the rank branch that never got fixed in that
 branch.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.96  2008/06/27 14:02:02  phase1geo
 Fixing splint and -Wextra warnings.  Also fixing comment formatting.

 Revision 1.95  2008/04/15 20:37:11  phase1geo
 Fixing database array support.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.94  2008/04/15 06:08:47  phase1geo
 First attempt to get both instance and module coverage calculatable for
 GUI purposes.  This is not quite complete at the moment though it does
 compile.

 Revision 1.93  2008/03/18 21:36:24  phase1geo
 Updates from regression runs.  Regressions still do not completely pass at
 this point.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.92  2008/03/17 22:02:31  phase1geo
 Adding new check_mem script and adding output to perform memory checking during
 regression runs.  Completed work on free_safe and added realloc_safe function
 calls.  Regressions are pretty broke at the moment.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.91  2008/03/17 05:26:16  phase1geo
 Checkpointing.  Things don't compile at the moment.

 Revision 1.90  2008/03/11 22:06:48  phase1geo
 Finishing first round of exception handling code.

 Revision 1.89  2008/03/04 00:09:20  phase1geo
 More exception handling.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.88  2008/01/30 05:51:50  phase1geo
 Fixing doxygen errors.  Updated parameter list syntax to make it more readable.

 Revision 1.87  2008/01/16 06:40:37  phase1geo
 More splint updates.

 Revision 1.86  2008/01/10 04:59:04  phase1geo
 More splint updates.  All exportlocal cases are now taken care of.

 Revision 1.85  2008/01/08 21:13:08  phase1geo
 Completed -weak splint run.  Full regressions pass.

 Revision 1.84  2008/01/07 23:59:54  phase1geo
 More splint updates.

 Revision 1.83  2007/12/18 23:55:21  phase1geo
 Starting to remove 64-bit time and replacing it with a sim_time structure
 for performance enhancement purposes.  Also removing global variables for time-related
 information and passing this information around by reference for performance
 enhancement purposes.

 Revision 1.82  2007/12/11 05:48:25  phase1geo
 Fixing more compile errors with new code changes and adding more profiling.
 Still have a ways to go before we can compile cleanly again (next submission
 should do it).

 Revision 1.81  2007/11/20 05:28:58  phase1geo
 Updating e-mail address from trevorw@charter.net to phase1geo@gmail.com.

 Revision 1.80  2007/09/13 17:03:30  phase1geo
 Cleaning up some const-ness corrections -- still more to go but it's a good
 start.

 Revision 1.79  2007/08/31 22:46:36  phase1geo
 Adding diagnostics from stable branch.  Fixing a few minor bugs and in progress
 of working on static_afunc1 failure (still not quite there yet).  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.78  2007/07/18 22:39:17  phase1geo
 Checkpointing generate work though we are at a fairly broken state at the moment.

 Revision 1.77  2007/07/18 02:15:04  phase1geo
 Attempts to fix a problem with generating instances with hierarchy.  Also fixing
 an issue with named blocks in generate statements.  Still some work to go before
 regressions are passing again, however.

 Revision 1.76  2007/04/18 22:35:02  phase1geo
 Revamping simulator core again.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.75  2007/04/11 22:29:48  phase1geo
 Adding support for CLI to score command.  Still some work to go to get history
 stuff right.  Otherwise, it seems to be working.

 Revision 1.74  2007/04/09 22:47:53  phase1geo
 Starting to modify the simulation engine for performance purposes.  Code is
 not complete and is untested at this point.

 Revision 1.73  2007/04/03 04:15:17  phase1geo
 Fixing bugs in func_iter functionality.  Modified functional unit name
 flattening function (though this does not appear to be working correctly
 at this time).  Added calls to funit_flatten_name in all of the reporting
 files.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.72  2007/04/02 20:19:36  phase1geo
 Checkpointing more work on use of functional iterators.  Not working correctly
 yet.

 Revision 1.71  2007/03/19 20:30:31  phase1geo
 More fixes to report command for instance flattening.  This seems to be
 working now as far as I can tell.  Regressions still have about 8 diagnostics
 failing with report errors.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.70  2007/03/19 03:30:16  phase1geo
 More fixes to instance flattening algorithm.  Still much more work to do here.
 Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.69  2007/03/16 21:41:09  phase1geo
 Checkpointing some work in fixing regressions for unnamed scope additions.
 Getting closer but still need to properly handle the removal of functional units.

 Revision 1.68  2007/03/15 22:39:05  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in unnamed scope binding.

 Revision 1.67  2006/12/19 06:06:05  phase1geo
 Shortening unnamed scope name from $unnamed_%d to $u%d.  Also fixed a few
 bugs in the instance_flatten function (still more debug work to go here).
 Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.66  2006/12/19 05:23:39  phase1geo
 Added initial code for handling instance flattening for unnamed scopes.  This
 is partially working at this point but still needs some debugging.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.65  2006/10/16 21:34:46  phase1geo
 Increased max bit width from 1024 to 65536 to allow for more room for memories.
 Fixed issue with enumerated values being explicitly assigned unknown values and
 created error output message when an implicitly assigned enum followed an explicitly
 assign unknown enum value.  Fixed problem with generate blocks in different
 instantiations of the same module.  Fixed bug in parser related to setting the
 curr_packed global variable correctly.  Added enum2 and enum2.1 diagnostics to test
 suite to verify correct enumerate behavior for the changes made in this checkin.
 Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.64  2006/10/13 22:46:31  phase1geo
 Things are a bit of a mess at this point.  Adding generate12 diagnostic that
 shows a failure in properly handling generates of instances.

 Revision 1.63  2006/10/12 22:48:46  phase1geo
 Updates to remove compiler warnings.  Still some work left to go here.

 Revision 1.62  2006/10/09 17:54:19  phase1geo
 Fixing support for VPI to allow it to properly get linked to the simulator.
 Also fixed inconsistency in generate reports and updated appropriately in
 regressions for this change.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.61  2006/09/22 19:56:45  phase1geo
 Final set of fixes and regression updates per recent changes.  Full regression
 now passes.

 Revision 1.60  2006/09/22 04:23:04  phase1geo
 More fixes to support new signal range structure.  Still don't have full
 regressions passing at the moment.

 Revision 1.59  2006/09/08 22:39:50  phase1geo
 Fixes for memory problems.

 Revision 1.58  2006/09/07 21:59:24  phase1geo
 Fixing some bugs related to statement block removal.  Also made some significant
 optimizations to this code.

 Revision 1.57  2006/09/01 23:06:02  phase1geo
 Fixing regressions per latest round of changes.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.56  2006/09/01 04:06:37  phase1geo
 Added code to support more than one instance tree.  Currently, I am seeing
 quite a few memory errors that are causing some major problems at the moment.
 Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.55  2006/07/27 16:08:46  phase1geo
 Fixing several memory leak bugs, cleaning up output and fixing regression
 bugs.  Full regression now passes (including all current generate diagnostics).

 Revision 1.54  2006/07/21 22:39:01  phase1geo
 Started adding support for generated statements.  Still looks like I have
 some loose ends to tie here before I can call it good.  Added generate5
 diagnostic to regression suite -- this does not quite pass at this point, however.

 Revision 1.53  2006/07/21 20:12:46  phase1geo
 Fixing code to get generated instances and generated array of instances to
 work.  Added diagnostics to verify correct functionality.  Full regression
 passes.

 Revision 1.52  2006/07/18 19:03:21  phase1geo
 Sync'ing up to the scoping fixes from the 0.4.6 stable release.

 Revision 1.51  2006/07/17 22:12:42  phase1geo
 Adding more code for generate block support.  Still just adding code at this
 point -- hopefully I haven't broke anything that doesn't use generate blocks.

 Revision 1.50  2006/07/12 22:16:18  phase1geo
 Fixing hierarchical referencing for instance arrays.  Also attempted to fix
 a problem found with unary1; however, the generated report coverage information
 does not look correct at this time.  Checkpointing what I have done for now.

 Revision 1.49  2006/07/11 04:59:08  phase1geo
 Reworking the way that instances are being generated.  This is to fix a bug and
 pave the way for generate loops for instances.  Code not working at this point
 and may cause serious problems for regression runs.

 Revision 1.48  2006/07/10 19:30:55  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in instance.c that ignored the LSB information for an instance
 array (this also needs to be fixed for the 0.4.6 stable release).  Added
 diagnostic to verify correctness of this behavior.  Also added case statement
 to the generate parser.

 Revision 1.47  2006/07/10 03:05:04  phase1geo
 Contains bug fixes for memory leaks and segmentation faults.  Also contains
 some starting code to support generate blocks.  There is absolutely no
 functionality here, however.

 Revision 1.46  2006/06/27 19:34:43  phase1geo
 Permanent fix for the CDD save feature.

 Revision 1.45  2006/05/28 02:43:49  phase1geo
 Integrating stable release 0.4.4 changes into main branch.  Updated regressions
 appropriately.

 Revision 1.44  2006/05/25 12:11:01  phase1geo
 Including bug fix from 0.4.4 stable release and updating regressions.

 Revision 1.43  2006/04/21 06:14:45  phase1geo
 Merged in changes from 0.4.3 stable release.  Updated all regression files
 for inclusion of OVL library.  More documentation updates for next development
 release (but there is more to go here).

 Revision 1.42  2006/04/08 03:23:28  phase1geo
 Adding support for CVER simulator VPI support.  I think I may have also fixed
 support for VCS also.  Recreated configuration/Makefiles with newer version of
 auto* tools.

 Revision 1.41  2006/04/07 22:31:07  phase1geo
 Fixes to get VPI to work with VCS.  Getting close but still some work to go to
 get the callbacks to start working.

 Revision 1.40.4.1  2006/04/20 21:55:16  phase1geo
 Adding support for big endian signals.  Added new endian1 diagnostic to regression
 suite to verify this new functionality.  Full regression passes.  We may want to do
 some more testing on variants of this before calling it ready for stable release 0.4.3.

 Revision 1.40  2006/03/28 22:28:27  phase1geo
 Updates to user guide and added copyright information to each source file in the
 src directory.  Added test directory in user documentation directory containing the
 example used in line, toggle, combinational logic and FSM descriptions.

 Revision 1.39  2006/02/17 19:50:47  phase1geo
 Added full support for escaped names.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.38  2006/02/16 21:19:26  phase1geo
 Adding support for arrays of instances.  Also fixing some memory problems for
 constant functions and fixed binding problems when hierarchical references are
 made to merged modules.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.37  2006/01/24 23:24:38  phase1geo
 More updates to handle static functions properly.  I have redone quite a bit
 of code here which has regressions pretty broke at the moment.  More work
 to do but I'm checkpointing.

 Revision 1.36  2006/01/20 22:50:50  phase1geo
 Code cleanup.

 Revision 1.35  2006/01/20 22:44:51  phase1geo
 Moving parameter resolution to post-bind stage to allow static functions to
 be considered.  Regression passes without static function testing.  Static
 function support still has some work to go.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.34  2006/01/20 19:15:23  phase1geo
 Fixed bug to properly handle the scoping of parameters when parameters are created/used
 in non-module functional units.  Added param10*.v diagnostics to regression suite to
 verify the behavior is correct now.

 Revision 1.33  2006/01/16 17:27:41  phase1geo
 Fixing binding issues when designs have modules/tasks/functions that are either used
 more than once in a design or have the same name.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.32  2005/12/01 16:08:19  phase1geo
 Allowing nested functional units within a module to get parsed and handled correctly.
 Added new nested_block1 diagnostic to test nested named blocks -- will add more tests
 later for different combinations.  Updated regression suite which now passes.

 Revision 1.31  2005/11/08 23:12:09  phase1geo
 Fixes for function/task additions.  Still a lot of testing on these structures;
 however, regressions now pass again so we are checkpointing here.

 Revision 1.30  2004/03/16 05:45:43  phase1geo
 Checkin contains a plethora of changes, bug fixes, enhancements...
 Some of which include:  new diagnostics to verify bug fixes found in field,
 test generator script for creating new diagnostics, enhancing error reporting
 output to include filename and line number of failing code (useful for error
 regression testing), support for error regression testing, bug fixes for
 segmentation fault errors found in field, additional data integrity features,
 and code support for GUI tool (this submission does not include TCL files).

 Revision 1.29  2004/03/15 21:38:17  phase1geo
 Updated source files after running lint on these files.  Full regression
 still passes at this point.

 Revision 1.28  2003/01/14 05:52:16  phase1geo
 Fixing bug related to copying instance trees in modules that were previously
 parsed.  Added diagnostic param7.v to testsuite and regression.  Full
 regression passes.

 Revision 1.27  2003/01/13 14:30:05  phase1geo
 Initial code to fix problem with missing instances in CDD files.  Instance
 now shows up but parameters not calculated correctly.  Another checkin to
 follow will contain full fix.

 Revision 1.26  2003/01/04 03:56:27  phase1geo
 Fixing bug with parameterized modules.  Updated regression suite for changes.

 Revision 1.25  2003/01/03 05:53:19  phase1geo
 Removing unnecessary spaces.

 Revision 1.24  2002/12/05 14:45:17  phase1geo
 Removing assertion error from instance6.1 failure; however, this case does not
 work correctly according to instance6.2.v diagnostic.  Added @(...) output in
 report command for edge-triggered events.  Also fixed bug where a module could be
 parsed more than once.  Full regression does not pass at this point due to
 new instance6.2.v diagnostic.

 Revision 1.23  2002/11/05 00:20:07  phase1geo
 Adding development documentation.  Fixing problem with combinational logic
 output in report command and updating full regression.

 Revision 1.22  2002/11/02 16:16:20  phase1geo
 Cleaned up all compiler warnings in source and header files.

 Revision 1.21  2002/10/31 23:13:51  phase1geo
 Fixing C compatibility problems with cc and gcc.  Found a few possible problems
 with 64-bit vs. 32-bit compilation of the tool.  Fixed bug in parser that
 lead to bus errors.  Ran full regression in 64-bit mode without error.

 Revision 1.20  2002/10/29 19:57:50  phase1geo
 Fixing problems with beginning block comments within comments which are
 produced automatically by CVS.  Should fix warning messages from compiler.

 Revision 1.19  2002/10/13 13:55:52  phase1geo
 Fixing instance depth selection and updating all configuration files for
 regression.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.18  2002/10/01 13:21:25  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in report output for single and multi-bit selects.  Also modifying
 the way that parameters are dealt with to allow proper handling of run-time
 changing bit selects of parameter values.  Full regression passes again and
 all report generators have been updated for changes.

 Revision 1.17  2002/09/25 05:36:08  phase1geo
 Initial version of parameter support is now in place.  Parameters work on a
 basic level.  param1.v tests this basic functionality and param1.cdd contains
 the correct CDD output from handling parameters in this file.  Yeah!

 Revision 1.16  2002/09/25 02:51:44  phase1geo
 Removing need of vector nibble array allocation and deallocation during
 expression resizing for efficiency and bug reduction.  Other enhancements
 for parameter support.  Parameter stuff still not quite complete.

 Revision 1.15  2002/09/23 01:37:45  phase1geo
 Need to make some changes to the inst_parm structure and some associated
 functionality for efficiency purposes.  This checkin contains most of the
 changes to the parser (with the exception of signal sizing).

 Revision 1.14  2002/09/21 07:03:28  phase1geo
 Attached all parameter functions into db.c.  Just need to finish getting
 parser to correctly add override parameters.  Once this is complete, phase 3
 can start and will include regenerating expressions and signals before
 getting output to CDD file.

 Revision 1.13  2002/09/21 04:11:32  phase1geo
 Completed phase 1 for adding in parameter support.  Main code is written
 that will create an instance parameter from a given module parameter in
 its entirety.  The next step will be to complete the module parameter
 creation code all the way to the parser.  Regression still passes and
 everything compiles at this point.

 Revision 1.12  2002/09/19 05:25:19  phase1geo
 Fixing incorrect simulation of static values and fixing reports generated
 from these static expressions.  Also includes some modifications for parameters
 though these changes are not useful at this point.

 Revision 1.11  2002/09/06 03:05:28  phase1geo
 Some ideas about handling parameters have been added to these files.  Added
 "Special Thanks" section in User's Guide for acknowledgements to people
 helping in project.

 Revision 1.10  2002/08/19 04:34:07  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in database reading code that dealt with merging modules.  Module
 merging is now performed in a more optimal way.  Full regression passes and
 own examples pass as well.

 Revision 1.9  2002/07/18 05:50:45  phase1geo
 Fixes should be just about complete for instance depth problems now.  Diagnostics
 to help verify instance handling are added to regression.  Full regression passes.
