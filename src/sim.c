 \par
 The simulation engine is made up of three parts:
 -# pre-simulation statement queue
 -# statement simulation engine
 -# expression simulation engine

 \par
 The operation of the simulation engine is as follows.  When a signal is found
 in the VCD file, the expressions to which it is a part of the RHS are looked up
 in the design tree.  The expression tree is then parsed from the expression to
 the root, setting the #ESUPPL_IS_LEFT_CHANGED or #ESUPPL_IS_RIGHT_CHANGED as it 
 makes its way to the root.  When at the root expression, the #ESUPPL_IS_STMT_HEAD 
 bit is interrogated.  If this bit is a 1, the expression's statement is loaded 
 into the pre-simulation statement queue.  If the bit is a 0, no further action is 
 taken.

 \par
 Once the timestep marker has been set, the simulate function is called.  The 
 statement located at the head of the queue is placed into the statement simulation 
 engine and the head pointer is set to point to the next statement in the queue.  
 The head statement is continually taken until the pre-simulation statement queue 
 is empty.  This signifies that the timestep has been completed.

 \par
 When a statement is placed into the statement simulation engine, the #ESUPPL_IS_STMT_HEAD 
 bit is cleared in the root expression.  Additionally, the root expression pointed to by 
 the statement is interrogated to see if the #ESUPPL_IS_LEFT_CHANGED or #ESUPPL_IS_RIGHT_CHANGED 
 bits are set.  If one or both of the bits are found to be set, the root expression 
 is placed into the expression simulation engine for further processing.  When the 
 statement's expression has completed its simulation, the value of the root expression 
 is used to determine if the next_true or next_false path will be taken.  If the value 
 of the root expression is true, the next_true statement is loaded into the statement 
 simulation engine.  If the value of the root expression is false and the next_false 
 pointer is NULL, this signifies that the current statement tree has completed for this 
 timestep.  At this point, the current statement will set the #ESUPPL_IS_STMT_HEAD bit in 
 its root expression and is removed from the statement simulation engine.  The next statement 
 at the head of the pre-simulation statement queue is then loaded into the statement 
 simulation engine.  If next_false statement is not NULL, it is loaded into the statement 
 simulation engine and work is done on that statement.

 \par
 When a root expression is placed into the expression simulation engine, the tree is
 traversed, following the paths that have set #ESUPPL_IS_LEFT_CHANGED or 
 #ESUPPL_IS_RIGHT_CHANGED bits set.  Each expression tree is traversed depth first.  When an 
 expression is reached that does not have either of these bits set, we have reached the expression
 whose value has changed.  When this expression is found, it is evaluated and the
 resulting value is stored into its value vector.  Once this has occurred, the parent
 expression checks to see if the other child expression has changed value.  If so,
 that child expression's tree is traversed.  Once both child expressions contain the
 current value for the current timestep, the parent expression evaluates its
 expression with the values of its children and clears both the #ESUPPL_IS_LEFT_CHANGED and
 #ESUPPL_IS_RIGHT_CHANGED bits to indicate that both children were evaluated.  The resulting
 value is stored into the current expression's value vector and the parent expression
 of the current expression is worked on.  This evaluation process continues until the
 root expression of the tree has been evaluated.  At this point the expression tree
 is removed from the expression simulation engine and the associated statement worked
 on by the statement simulation engine as specified above.

 $Log$
 Revision 1.127.2.1  2008/07/10 22:43:54  phase1geo
 Merging in rank-devel-branch into this branch.  Added -f options for all commands
 to allow files containing command-line arguments to be added.  A few error diagnostics
 are currently failing due to changes in the rank branch that never got fixed in that
 branch.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.130.2.1  2008/07/02 04:40:18  phase1geo
 Adding merge5* diagnostics to verify rank function (this is not complete yet).  The
 rank function is a bit broken at this point.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.130  2008/06/27 14:02:04  phase1geo
 Fixing splint and -Wextra warnings.  Also fixing comment formatting.

 Revision 1.129  2008/06/20 18:43:41  phase1geo
 Updating source files to optimize code when the --enable-debug option is specified.
 The performance was almost 8x worse with this option enabled, now it should be
 almost as good as without the mode (although, not completely).  Full regression
 passes.

 Revision 1.128  2008/06/19 16:14:55  phase1geo
 leaned up all warnings in source code from -Wall.  This also seems to have cleared
 up a few runtime issues.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.127  2008/05/30 05:38:32  phase1geo
 Updating development tree with development branch.  Also attempting to fix
 bug 1965927.

 Revision 1.126.2.3  2008/05/27 04:29:31  phase1geo
 Fixing memory leak for an FSM arc parser error.  Adding diagnostics to regression
 suite for coverage purposes.

 Revision 1.126.2.2  2008/05/08 23:12:43  phase1geo
 Fixing several bugs and reworking code in arc to get FSM diagnostics
 to pass.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.126.2.1  2008/05/07 05:22:51  phase1geo
 Fixing reporting bug with line coverage for continuous assignments.  Updating
 regression files and checkpointing.

 Revision 1.126  2008/03/31 21:40:23  phase1geo
 Fixing several more memory issues and optimizing a bit of code per regression
 failures.  Full regression still does not pass but does complete (yeah!)
 Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.125  2008/03/30 05:14:32  phase1geo
 Optimizing sim_expr_changed functionality and fixing bug 1928475.

 Revision 1.124  2008/03/17 05:26:17  phase1geo
 Checkpointing.  Things don't compile at the moment.

 Revision 1.123  2008/02/29 00:08:31  phase1geo
 Completed optimization code in simulator.  Still need to verify that code
 changes enhanced performances as desired.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.122  2008/02/28 07:54:09  phase1geo
 Starting to add functionality for simulation optimization in the sim_expr_changed
 function (feature request 1897410).

 Revision 1.121  2008/02/27 05:26:51  phase1geo
 Adding support for $finish and $stop.

 Revision 1.120  2008/02/25 18:22:16  phase1geo
 Moved statement supplemental bits from root expression to statement and starting
 to add support for race condition checking pragmas (still some work left to do
 on this item).  Updated IV and Cver regressions per these changes.

 Revision 1.119  2008/02/23 00:26:02  phase1geo
 Fixing bug 1899768 and adding extra debug information.

 Revision 1.118  2008/01/30 05:51:50  phase1geo
 Fixing doxygen errors.  Updated parameter list syntax to make it more readable.

 Revision 1.117  2008/01/10 04:59:04  phase1geo
 More splint updates.  All exportlocal cases are now taken care of.

 Revision 1.116  2008/01/09 05:22:22  phase1geo
 More splint updates using the -standard option.

 Revision 1.115  2008/01/08 21:13:08  phase1geo
 Completed -weak splint run.  Full regressions pass.

 Revision 1.114  2007/12/20 04:47:50  phase1geo
 Fixing the last of the regression failures from previous changes.  Removing unnecessary
 output used for debugging.

 Revision 1.113  2007/12/19 22:54:35  phase1geo
 More compiler fixes (almost there now).  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.112  2007/12/18 23:55:21  phase1geo
 Starting to remove 64-bit time and replacing it with a sim_time structure
 for performance enhancement purposes.  Also removing global variables for time-related
 information and passing this information around by reference for performance
 enhancement purposes.

 Revision 1.111  2007/12/14 23:38:37  phase1geo
 More performance enhancements.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.110  2007/12/13 14:25:12  phase1geo
 Attempting to enhance performance of the sim_simulation function (I have a few
 different code segments here to do the task at the moment).

 Revision 1.109  2007/12/13 02:32:39  phase1geo
 Fixing segmentation fault.

 Revision 1.108  2007/12/12 23:36:57  phase1geo
 Optimized vector_op_add function significantly.  Other improvements made to
 profiler output.  Attempted to optimize the sim_simulation function although
 it hasn't had the intended effect and delay1.3 is currently failing.  Checkpointing
 for now.

 Revision 1.107  2007/12/12 14:17:44  phase1geo
 Enhancing the profiling report.

 Revision 1.106  2007/12/12 08:04:15  phase1geo
 Adding more timed functions for profiling purposes.

 Revision 1.105  2007/12/12 07:23:19  phase1geo
 More work on profiling.  I have now included the ability to get function runtimes.
 Still more work to do but everything is currently working at the moment.

 Revision 1.104  2007/12/11 05:48:26  phase1geo
 Fixing more compile errors with new code changes and adding more profiling.
 Still have a ways to go before we can compile cleanly again (next submission
 should do it).

 Updating e-mail address from trevorw@charter.net to phase1geo@gmail.com.

 Revision 1.102  2007/09/04 22:50:50  phase1geo
 Fixed static_afunc1 issues.  Reran regressions and updated necessary files.
 Also working on debugging one remaining issue with mem1.v (not solved yet).

 Revision 1.101  2007/07/30 22:42:02  phase1geo
 Making some progress on automatic function support.  Things currently don't compile
 but I need to checkpoint for now.

 Revision 1.100  2007/07/27 21:57:08  phase1geo
 Adding afunc1 diagnostic to regression suite (though this diagnostic does not
 currently pass).  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.99  2007/07/27 19:11:27  phase1geo
 Putting in rest of support for automatic functions/tasks.  Checked in
 atask1 diagnostic files.

 Revision 1.98  2007/07/26 22:23:00  phase1geo

 Updating ChangeLog and fixing some compile issues with the VPI library.

 Revision 1.95  2007/07/16 18:39:59  phase1geo
 Finishing adding accumulated coverage output to report files.  Also fixed
 compiler warnings with static values in C code that are inputs to 64-bit
 variables.  Full regression was not run with these changes due to pre-existing
 simulator problems in core code.

 Revision 1.94  2007/04/20 22:56:46  phase1geo
 More regression updates and simulator core fixes.  Still a ways to go.

 Revision 1.93  2007/04/18 22:35:02  phase1geo

 Revision 1.92  2007/04/13 21:47:12  phase1geo
 More simulation debugging.  Added 'display all_list' command to CLI to output
 the list of all threads.  Updated regressions though we are not fully passing
 at the moment.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.91  2007/04/12 21:35:20  phase1geo
 More bug fixes to simulation core.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.90  2007/04/12 20:54:55  phase1geo
 Adding cli > output when replaying and adding back all of the functions (since
 the cli > prompt helps give it context.  Fixing bugs in simulation core.
 Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.89  2007/04/12 04:15:40  phase1geo
 Adding history all command, added list command and updated the display current
 command to include statement output.

 Revision 1.88  2007/04/11 22:29:48  phase1geo
 Adding support for CLI to score command.  Still some work to go to get history
 stuff right.  Otherwise, it seems to be working.

 Revision 1.87  2007/04/10 22:10:11  phase1geo
 Fixing some more simulation issues.

 Revision 1.86  2007/04/10 03:56:18  phase1geo
 Completing majority of code to support new simulation core.  Starting to debug
 this though we still have quite a ways to go here.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.85  2007/04/09 22:47:53  phase1geo
 Starting to modify the simulation engine for performance purposes.  Code is
 not complete and is untested at this point.

 Revision 1.84  2006/12/18 23:58:34  phase1geo
 Fixes for automatic tasks.  Added atask1 diagnostic to regression suite to verify.
 Other fixes to parser for blocks.  We need to add code to properly handle unnamed
 scopes now before regressions will get to a passing state.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.83  2006/12/15 17:33:45  phase1geo
 Updating TODO list.  Fixing more problems associated with handling re-entrant
 tasks/functions.  Still not quite there yet for simulation, but we are getting
 quite close now.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.82  2006/12/12 06:20:23  phase1geo
 More updates to support re-entrant tasks/functions.  Still working through
 compiler errors.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.81  2006/11/30 19:58:11  phase1geo
 Fixing rest of issues so that full regression (IV, Cver and VCS) without VPI
 passes.  Updated regression files.

 Revision 1.80  2006/11/30 05:04:23  phase1geo
 More fixes to new simulation algorithm.  Still have a couple of failures that
 need to be looked at.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.79  2006/11/29 23:15:46  phase1geo
 Major overhaul to simulation engine by including an appropriate delay queue
 mechanism to handle simulation timing for delay operations.  Regression not
 fully passing at this moment but enough is working to checkpoint this work.

 Revision 1.78  2006/11/28 16:39:46  phase1geo
 More updates for regressions due to changes in delay handling.  Still work
 to go.

 Revision 1.77  2006/11/27 04:11:42  phase1geo
 Adding more changes to properly support thread time.  This is a work in progress
 and regression is currently broken for the moment.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.76  2006/11/24 05:30:15  phase1geo
 Checking in fix for proper handling of delays.  This does not include the use
 of timescales (which will be fixed next).  Full IV regression now passes.

 Revision 1.75  2006/11/22 20:20:01  phase1geo
 Updates to properly support 64-bit time.  Also starting to make changes to
 simulator to support "back simulation" for when the current simulation time
 has advanced out quite a bit of time and the simulator needs to catch up.
 This last feature is not quite working at the moment and regressions are
 currently broken.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.74  2006/10/12 22:48:46  phase1geo
 Updates to remove compiler warnings.  Still some work left to go here.

 Revision 1.73  2006/10/06 17:18:13  phase1geo

 suite.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.72  2006/08/28 22:28:28  phase1geo
 Fixing bug 1546059 to match stable branch.  Adding support for repeated delay
 expressions (i.e., a = repeat(2) @(b) c).  Fixing support for event delayed
 assignments (i.e., a = @(b) c).  Adding several new diagnostics to verify this
 new level of support and updating regressions for these changes.  Also added
 parser support for logic port types.

 Revision 1.71  2006/08/21 22:50:01  phase1geo
 Adding more support for delayed assignments.  Added dly_assign1 to testsuite
 to verify the #... type of delayed assignment.  This seems to be working for
 this case but has a potential issue in the report generation.  Checkpointing
 work.

 Revision 1.70  2006/08/18 22:07:45  phase1geo
 Integrating obfuscation into all user-viewable output.  Verified that these
 changes have not made an impact on regressions.  Also improved performance
 impact of not obfuscating output.

 Revision 1.69  2006/08/11 18:57:04  phase1geo
 Adding support for always_comb, always_latch and always_ff statement block
 types.  Added several diagnostics to regression suite to verify this new
 behavior.

 Revision 1.68  2006/03/28 22:28:28  phase1geo
 Updates to user guide and added copyright information to each source file in the
 src directory.  Added test directory in user documentation directory containing the
 example used in line, toggle, combinational logic and FSM descriptions.

 Revision 1.67  2006/03/27 23:25:30  phase1geo
 Updating development documentation for 0.4 stable release.

 Revision 1.66  2006/01/23 17:23:28  phase1geo
 Fixing scope issues that came up when port assignment was added.  Full regression
 now passes.

 Revision 1.65  2006/01/09 04:15:25  phase1geo
 Attempting to fix one last problem with latest changes.  Regression runs are
 currently running.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.64  2006/01/08 05:51:03  phase1geo
 Added optimizations to EOR and AEDGE expressions.  In the process of running
 regressions...

 Revision 1.63  2006/01/08 03:05:06  phase1geo
 Checkpointing work on optimized thread handling.  I believe that this is now
 working as wanted; however, regressions will not pass until EOR optimization
 has been completed.  I will be working on this next.

 Revision 1.62  2006/01/06 23:39:10  phase1geo
 Started working on removing the need to simulate more than is necessary.  Things
 are pretty broken at this point, but all of the code should be in -- debugging.

 Revision 1.61  2006/01/06 18:54:03  phase1geo
 Breaking up expression_operate function into individual functions for each
 expression operation.  Also storing additional information in a globally accessible,
 constant structure array to increase performance.  Updating full regression for these
 changes.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.60  2006/01/05 05:52:06  phase1geo
 Removing wait bit in vector supplemental field and modifying algorithm to only
 assign in the post-sim location (pre-sim now is gone).  This fixes some issues
 with simulation results and increases performance a bit.  Updated regressions
 for these changes.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.59  2006/01/04 22:07:04  phase1geo
 Changing expression execution calculation from sim to expression_operate function.
 Updating all regression files for this change.  Modifications to diagnostic Makefile
 to accommodate environments that do not have valgrind.

 Revision 1.58  2006/01/03 23:00:18  phase1geo
 Removing debugging output from last checkin.

 Revision 1.57  2006/01/03 22:59:16  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in expression_assign function -- removed recursive assignment when
 the LHS expression is a signal, single-bit, multi-bit or static value (only
 recurse when the LHS is a CONCAT or LIST).  Fixing bug in db_close function to
 check if the instance tree has been populated before deallocating memory for it.
 Fixing bug in report help information when Tcl/Tk is not available.  Added bassign2
 diagnostic to regression suite to verify first described bug.

 Revision 1.56  2005/12/31 05:00:57  phase1geo
 Updating regression due to recent changes in adding exec_num field in expression
 and removing the executed bit in the expression supplemental field.  This will eventually
 allow us to get information on where the simulator is spending the most time.

 Revision 1.55  2005/12/12 23:25:37  phase1geo
 Fixing memory faults.  This is a work in progress.

 Revision 1.54  2005/12/07 21:50:51  phase1geo
 Added support for repeat blocks.  Added repeat1 to regression and fixed errors.
 Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.53  2005/12/05 23:30:35  phase1geo
 Adding support for disabling tasks.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.52  2005/12/05 22:45:39  phase1geo
 Bug fixes to disable code when disabling ourselves -- we move thread killing
 to be done by the sim_thread routine only.

 Revision 1.51  2005/12/05 22:02:24  phase1geo
 Added initial support for disable expression.  Added test to verify functionality.
 Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.50  2005/11/30 18:25:56  phase1geo
 Fixing named block code.  Full regression now passes.  Still more work to do on
 named blocks, however.

 Revision 1.49  2005/11/29 19:04:48  phase1geo
 Adding tests to verify task functionality.  Updating failing tests and fixed
 bugs for context switch expressions at the end of a statement block, statement
 block removal for missing function/tasks and thread killing.

 Revision 1.48  2005/11/28 23:28:47  phase1geo
 Checkpointing with additions for threads.

 Revision 1.47  2005/11/22 05:30:33  phase1geo
 Updates to regression suite for clearing the assigned bit when a statement
 block is removed from coverage consideration and it is assigning that signal.
 This is not fully working at this point.

 Revision 1.46  2005/11/21 23:31:06  phase1geo
 Adding support for initial statement blocks.  Added first initial1 diagnostic
 to regression suite.  This support seems to be working for the moment -- still
 need to run regressions.

 Revision 1.45  2005/11/21 22:21:58  phase1geo
 More regression updates.  Also made some updates to debugging output.

 Revision 1.44  2005/11/21 04:17:43  phase1geo
 More updates to regression suite -- includes several bug fixes.  Also added --enable-debug
 facility to configuration file which will include or exclude debugging output from being
 generated.

 Revision 1.43  2005/11/18 23:52:55  phase1geo
 More regression cleanup -- still quite a few errors to handle here.

 Revision 1.42  2005/11/18 05:17:01  phase1geo
 Updating regressions with latest round of changes.  Also added bit-fill capability
 to expression_assign function -- still more changes to come.  We need to fix the
 expression sizing problem for RHS expressions of assignment operators.

 Revision 1.41  2005/11/17 23:35:16  phase1geo
 Blocking assignment is now working properly along with support for event expressions
 (currently only the original PEDGE, NEDGE, AEDGE and DELAY are supported but more
 can now follow).  Added new race4 diagnostic to verify that a register cannot be
 assigned from more than one location -- this works.  Regression fails at this point.

 Revision 1.40  2005/11/17 05:34:44  phase1geo
 Initial work on supporting blocking assignments.  Added new diagnostic to
 check that this initial work is working correctly.  Quite a bit more work to
 do here.

 Revision 1.39  2005/02/08 23:18:23  phase1geo
 Starting to add code to handle expression assignment for blocking assignments.
 At this point, regressions will probably still pass but new code isn't doing exactly
 what I want.

 Revision 1.38  2005/01/07 17:59:52  phase1geo
 Finalized updates for supplemental field changes.  Everything compiles and links
 correctly at this time; however, a regression run has not confirmed the changes.

 Revision 1.37  2004/11/08 12:35:34  phase1geo
 More updates to improve efficiency.

 Revision 1.36  2004/03/30 15:42:15  phase1geo
 Renaming signal type to vsignal type to eliminate compilation problems on systems
 that contain a signal type in the OS.

 Revision 1.35  2003/11/29 06:55:49  phase1geo
 Fixing leftover bugs in better report output changes.  Fixed bug in param.c
 where parameters found in RHS expressions that were part of statements that
 were being removed were not being properly removed.  Fixed bug in sim.c where
 expressions in tree above conditional operator were not being evaluated if
 conditional expression was not at the top of tree.

 Revision 1.34  2003/11/05 05:22:56  phase1geo
 Final fix for bug 835366.  Full regression passes once again.

 Revision 1.33  2003/10/14 04:02:44  phase1geo
 Final fixes for new FSM support.  Full regression now passes.  Need to
 add new diagnostics to verify new functionality, but at least all existing
 cases are supported again.

 Revision 1.32  2003/10/13 22:10:07  phase1geo
 More changes for FSM support.  Still not quite there.

 Revision 1.31  2003/08/15 03:52:22  phase1geo
 More checkins of last checkin and adding some missing files.

 Revision 1.30  2003/08/10 03:50:10  phase1geo
 More development documentation updates.  All global variables are now
 documented correctly.  Also fixed some generated documentation warnings.
 Removed some unnecessary global variables.

 Revision 1.29  2003/08/05 20:25:05  phase1geo
 Fixing non-blocking bug and updating regression files according to the fix.
 Also added function vector_is_unknown() which can be called before making
 a call to vector_to_int() which will eleviate any X/Z-values causing problems
 with this conversion.  Additionally, the real1.1 regression report files were
 updated.

 Revision 1.28  2002/11/27 06:03:35  phase1geo
 Adding diagnostics to verify selectable delay.  Removing selectable delay
 warning from being output constantly to only outputting when selectable delay
 found in design and -T option not specified.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.27  2002/11/27 03:49:20  phase1geo
 Fixing bugs in score and report commands for regression.  Finally fixed
 static expression calculation to yield proper coverage results for constant
 expressions.  Updated regression suite and development documentation for
 changes.

 Cleaned up all compiler warnings in source and header files.

 Revision 1.25  2002/10/31 23:14:24  phase1geo
 Fixing C compatibility problems with cc and gcc.  Found a few possible problems
 with 64-bit vs. 32-bit compilation of the tool.  Fixed bug in parser that
 lead to bus errors.  Ran full regression in 64-bit mode without error.

 Revision 1.24  2002/10/29 19:57:51  phase1geo
 Fixing problems with beginning block comments within comments which are
 produced automatically by CVS.  Should fix warning messages from compiler.

 Revision 1.23  2002/10/29 13:33:21  phase1geo
 Adding patches for 64-bit compatibility.  Reformatted parser.y for easier
 viewing (removed tabs).  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.22  2002/10/25 13:43:49  phase1geo
 Adding statement iterators for moving in both directions in a list with a single
 pointer (two-way).  This allows us to reverse statement lists without additional
 memory and time (very efficient).  Full regression passes and TODO list items
 2 and 3 are completed.

 Revision 1.21  2002/09/19 05:25:20  phase1geo
 Fixing incorrect simulation of static values and fixing reports generated
 from these static expressions.  Also includes some modifications for parameters
 though these changes are not useful at this point.

 Revision 1.20  2002/07/14 05:10:42  phase1geo
 Added support for signal concatenation in score and report commands.  Fixed
 bugs in this code (and multiplication).

 Revision 1.19  2002/07/10 03:01:50  phase1geo
 Added define1.v and define2.v diagnostics to regression suite.  Both diagnostics
 now pass.  Fixed cases where constants were not causing proper TRUE/FALSE values
 to be calculated.

 Revision 1.18  2002/07/05 00:37:37  phase1geo
 Small update to CASE handling in scope to avoid future errors.

 Revision 1.17  2002/07/03 21:30:53  phase1geo
 Fixed remaining issues with always statements.  Full regression is running
 error free at this point.  Regenerated documentation.  Added EOR expression
 operation to handle the or expression in event lists.

 Revision 1.16  2002/07/03 19:54:36  phase1geo
 Adding/fixing code to properly handle always blocks with the event control
 structures attached.  Added several new diagnostics to test this ability.
 always1.v is still failing but the rest are passing.

 Revision 1.15  2002/07/03 00:59:14  phase1geo
 Fixing bug with conditional statements and other "deep" expression trees.

 Revision 1.14  2002/07/02 19:52:50  phase1geo
 Removing unecessary diagnostics.  Cleaning up extraneous output and
 generating new documentation from source.  Regression passes at the
 current time.

 Revision 1.13  2002/07/02 18:42:18  phase1geo
 Various bug fixes.  Added support for multiple signals sharing the same VCD
 symbol.  Changed conditional support to allow proper simulation results.
 Updated VCD parser to allow for symbols containing only alphanumeric characters.

 Revision 1.12  2002/07/01 15:10:42  phase1geo
 Fixing always loopbacks and setting stop bits correctly.  All verilog diagnostics
 seem to be passing with these fixes.

 Revision 1.11  2002/06/28 03:04:59  phase1geo
 Fixing more errors found by diagnostics.  Things are running pretty well at
 this point with current diagnostics.  Still some report output problems.

 Revision 1.10  2002/06/28 00:40:37  phase1geo
 Cleaning up extraneous output from debugging.

 Revision 1.9  2002/06/27 20:39:43  phase1geo

 fairly well now.  Added rest of support for delays.

 Revision 1.8  2002/06/26 04:59:50  phase1geo
 Adding initial support for delays.  Support is not yet complete and is
 currently untested.

 Revision 1.7  2002/06/26 03:45:48  phase1geo
 Fixing more bugs in simulator and report functions.  About to add support
 for delay statements.

 Revision 1.6  2002/06/25 21:46:10  phase1geo
 Fixes to simulator and reporting.  Still some bugs here.

 Revision 1.5  2002/06/25 03:39:03  phase1geo
 Fixed initial scoring bugs.  We now generate a legal CDD file for reporting.
 Fixed some report bugs though there are still some remaining.

 Revision 1.4  2002/06/23 21:18:22  phase1geo
 Added appropriate statement support in parser.  All parts should be in place
 and ready to start testing.

 Revision 1.3  2002/06/22 21:08:23  phase1geo
 Added simulation engine and tied it to the db.c file.  Simulation engine is
 currently untested and will remain so until the parser is updated correctly
 for statements.  This will be the next step.
