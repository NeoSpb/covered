 \par
 The contents of this file contain functions to handle race condition checking and information
 handling regarding race conditions.  Since race conditions can cause the Covered simulator to not
 provide the same run-time order as the primary Verilog simulator, we need to be able to detect when
 race conditions are occurring within the design.  The conditions that are checked within the design
 during the parsing stage can be found \ref race_condition_types.

 \par
 The failure of any one of these rules will cause Covered to either display warning type messages to the user when
 the race condition checking flag has not been set or error messages when the race condition checking flag has
 been set by the user.

 information and passing this information around by reference for performance
 enhancement purposes.

 Revision 1.60  2007/12/11 05:48:26  phase1geo
 Fixing more compile errors with new code changes and adding more profiling.
 Still have a ways to go before we can compile cleanly again (next submission
 should do it).

 Revision 1.59  2007/11/20 05:28:59  phase1geo
 Updating e-mail address from trevorw@charter.net to phase1geo@gmail.com.

 Revision 1.58  2007/07/26 22:23:00  phase1geo
 Starting to work on the functionality for automatic tasks/functions.  Just
 checkpointing some work.

 Revision 1.57  2007/07/26 17:05:15  phase1geo
 Fixing problem with static functions (vector data associated with expressions
 were not being allocated).  Regressions have been run.  Only two failures
 in total still to be fixed.

 Revision 1.56  2007/04/03 18:55:57  phase1geo
 Fixing more bugs in reporting mechanisms for unnamed scopes.  Checking in more
 regression updates per these changes.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.55  2007/03/30 22:43:13  phase1geo
 Regression fixes.  Still have a ways to go but we are getting close.

 Revision 1.54  2006/12/18 23:58:34  phase1geo
 Fixes for automatic tasks.  Added atask1 diagnostic to regression suite to verify.
 Other fixes to parser for blocks.  We need to add code to properly handle unnamed
 scopes now before regressions will get to a passing state.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.53  2006/12/15 17:33:45  phase1geo
 Updating TODO list.  Fixing more problems associated with handling re-entrant
 tasks/functions.  Still not quite there yet for simulation, but we are getting
 quite close now.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.52  2006/12/14 04:19:35  phase1geo
 More updates to parser and associated code to handle unnamed scopes and
 fixing more code to use functional unit pointers in expressions instead of
 statement pointers.  Still not fully compiling at this point.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.51  2006/10/12 22:48:46  phase1geo
 Updates to remove compiler warnings.  Still some work left to go here.

 Revision 1.50  2006/10/04 22:04:16  phase1geo
 Updating rest of regressions.  Modified the way we are setting the memory rd
 vector data bit (should optimize the score command just a bit).  Also updated
 quite a bit of memory coverage documentation though I still need to finish
 documenting how to understand the report file for this metric.  Cleaning up
 other things and fixing a few more software bugs from regressions.  Added
 marray2* diagnostics to verify endianness in the unpacked dimension list.

 Revision 1.49  2006/10/03 22:47:00  phase1geo
 Adding support for read coverage to memories.  Also added memory coverage as
 a report output for DIAGLIST diagnostics in regressions.  Fixed various bugs
 left in code from array changes and updated regressions for these changes.
 At this point, all IV diagnostics pass regressions.

 Revision 1.48  2006/09/25 22:22:28  phase1geo
 Adding more support for memory reporting to both score and report commands.
 We are getting closer; however, regressions are currently broken.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.47  2006/09/20 22:38:09  phase1geo
 Lots of changes to support memories and multi-dimensional arrays.  We still have
 issues with endianness and VCS regressions have not been run, but this is a significant
 amount of work that needs to be checkpointed.

 Revision 1.46  2006/09/15 22:14:54  phase1geo
 Working on adding arrayed signals.  This is currently in progress and doesn't
 even compile at this point, much less work.  Checkpointing work.

 Revision 1.45  2006/09/05 21:00:45  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in removing statements that are generate items.  Also added parsing
 support for multi-dimensional array accessing (no functionality here to support
 these, however).  Fixing bug in race condition checker for generated items.
 Currently hitting into problem with genvars used in SBIT_SEL or MBIT_SEL type
 expressions -- we are hitting into an assertion error in expression_operate_recursively.

 Revision 1.44  2006/08/18 22:07:45  phase1geo
 Integrating obfuscation into all user-viewable output.  Verified that these
 changes have not made an impact on regressions.  Also improved performance
 impact of not obfuscating output.

 Revision 1.43  2006/08/11 18:57:04  phase1geo
 Adding support for always_comb, always_latch and always_ff statement block
 types.  Added several diagnostics to regression suite to verify this new
 behavior.

 Revision 1.42  2006/07/21 20:12:46  phase1geo
 Fixing code to get generated instances and generated array of instances to
 work.  Added diagnostics to verify correct functionality.  Full regression
 passes.

 Revision 1.41  2006/04/14 17:05:13  phase1geo
 Reorganizing info line to make it more succinct and easier for future needs.
 Fixed problems with VPI library with recent merge changes.  Regression has
 been completely updated for these changes.

 Revision 1.40  2006/04/13 22:17:47  phase1geo
 Adding the beginning of the OVL assertion extractor.  So far the -a option is
 parsed and the race condition checker is turned off for all detectable
 OVL assertion modules (we will trust that these modules don't have race conditions
 inherent in them).

 Revision 1.39  2006/03/28 22:28:28  phase1geo
 Updates to user guide and added copyright information to each source file in the
 src directory.  Added test directory in user documentation directory containing the
 example used in line, toggle, combinational logic and FSM descriptions.

 Revision 1.38  2006/03/27 23:25:30  phase1geo
 Updating development documentation for 0.4 stable release.

 Revision 1.37  2006/03/27 17:37:23  phase1geo
 Fixing race condition output.  Some regressions may fail due to these changes.

 Revision 1.36  2006/02/10 16:44:29  phase1geo
 Adding support for register assignment.  Added diagnostic to regression suite
 to verify its implementation.  Updated TODO.  Full regression passes at this
 point.

 Revision 1.35  2006/01/31 16:41:00  phase1geo
 Adding initial support and diagnostics for the variable multi-bit select
 operators +: and -:.  More to come but full regression passes.

 Revision 1.34  2006/01/23 17:23:28  phase1geo
 Fixing scope issues that came up when port assignment was added.  Full regression
 now passes.

 Revision 1.33  2005/12/23 20:59:34  phase1geo
 Fixing assertion error in race condition checker.  Full regression runs cleanly.

 Revision 1.32  2005/12/23 05:41:52  phase1geo
 Fixing several bugs in score command per bug report #1388339.  Fixed problem
 with race condition checker statement iterator to eliminate infinite looping (this
 was the problem in the original bug).  Also fixed expression assigment when static
 expressions are used in the LHS (caused an assertion failure).  Also fixed the race
 condition checker to properly pay attention to task calls, named blocks and fork
 statements to make sure that these are being handled correctly for race condition
 checking.  Fixed bug for signals that are on the LHS side of an assignment expression
 but is not being assigned (bit selects) so that these are NOT considered for race
 conditions.  Full regression is a bit broken now but the opened bug can now be closed.

 Revision 1.31  2005/12/08 19:47:00  phase1geo
 Fixed repeat2 simulation issues.  Fixed statement_connect algorithm, removed the
 need for a separate set_stop function and reshuffled the positions of esuppl bits.
 Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.30  2005/12/01 16:08:19  phase1geo
 Allowing nested functional units within a module to get parsed and handled correctly.
 Added new nested_block1 diagnostic to test nested named blocks -- will add more tests
 later for different combinations.  Updated regression suite which now passes.

 Revision 1.29  2005/11/25 22:03:20  phase1geo
 Fixing bugs in race condition checker when racing statement blocks are in
 different functional units.  Still some work to do here with what to do when
 conflicting statement block is in a task/function (I suppose we need to remove
 the calling statement block as well?)

 Revision 1.28  2005/11/25 16:48:48  phase1geo
 Fixing bugs in binding algorithm.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.27  2005/11/23 23:05:24  phase1geo
 Updating regression files.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.26  2005/11/18 23:52:55  phase1geo
 More regression cleanup -- still quite a few errors to handle here.

 Revision 1.25  2005/11/10 19:28:23  phase1geo
 Updates/fixes for tasks/functions.  Also updated Tcl/Tk scripts for these changes.
 Fixed bug with net_decl_assign statements -- the line, start column and end column
 information was incorrect, causing problems with the GUI output.

 Revision 1.24  2005/11/08 23:12:10  phase1geo
 Fixes for function/task additions.  Still a lot of testing on these structures;
 however, regressions now pass again so we are checkpointing here.

 Revision 1.23  2005/02/07 22:19:46  phase1geo
 Added code to output race condition reasons to informational bar.  Also added code to
 output toggle and combinational logic output to information bar when cursor is over
 an expression that, when clicked on, will take you to the detailed coverage window.

 Revision 1.22  2005/02/05 06:20:58  phase1geo
 Added ascii report output for race conditions.  There is a segmentation fault
 bug associated with instance reporting.  Need to look into further.

 Revision 1.21  2005/02/05 05:29:25  phase1geo
 Added race condition reporting to GUI.

 Revision 1.20  2005/02/05 04:13:30  phase1geo
 Started to add reporting capabilities for race condition information.  Modified
 race condition reason calculation and handling.  Ran -Wall on all code and cleaned
 things up.  Cleaned up regression as a result of these changes.  Full regression
 now passes.

 Revision 1.19  2005/02/04 23:55:53  phase1geo
 Adding code to support race condition information in CDD files.  All code is
 now in place for writing/reading this data to/from the CDD file (although
 nothing is currently done with it and it is currently untested).

 Revision 1.18  2005/02/03 05:48:33  phase1geo
 Fixing bugs in race condition checker.  Adding race2.1 diagnostic.  Regression
 currently has some failures due to these changes.

 Revision 1.17  2005/02/03 04:59:13  phase1geo
 Fixing bugs in race condition checker.  Updated regression.

 Revision 1.16  2005/02/01 05:11:18  phase1geo
 Updates to race condition checker to find blocking/non-blocking assignments in
 statement block.  Regression still runs clean.

 Revision 1.15  2005/01/27 13:33:50  phase1geo
 Added code to calculate if statement block is sequential, combinational, both
 or none.

 Revision 1.14  2005/01/25 13:42:27  phase1geo
 Fixing segmentation fault problem with race condition checking.  Added race1.1
 to regression.  Removed unnecessary output statements from previous debugging
 checkins.

 Revision 1.13  2005/01/11 14:24:16  phase1geo
 Intermediate checkin.

 Revision 1.12  2005/01/10 23:03:39  phase1geo
 Added code to properly report race conditions.  Added code to remove statement blocks
 from module when race conditions are found.

 Revision 1.11  2005/01/10 13:44:58  phase1geo
 Fixing case where signal selects are being assigned by different statements that
 do not overlap.  We do not have race conditions in this case.

 Revision 1.10  2005/01/10 02:59:30  phase1geo
 Code added for race condition checking that checks for signals being assigned
 in multiple statements.  Working on handling bit selects -- this is in progress.

 Revision 1.9  2005/01/07 17:59:52  phase1geo
 Finalized updates for supplemental field changes.  Everything compiles and links
 correctly at this time; however, a regression run has not confirmed the changes.

 Revision 1.8  2005/01/04 14:37:00  phase1geo
 New changes for race condition checking.  Things are uncompilable at this
 point.

 Revision 1.7  2004/12/20 04:12:00  phase1geo
