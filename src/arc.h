 $Log$
 Revision 1.27.2.3  2008/05/08 23:12:41  phase1geo
 Fixing several bugs and reworking code in arc to get FSM diagnostics
 to pass.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.27.2.2  2008/05/08 03:56:38  phase1geo
 Updating regression files and reworking arc_find and arc_add functionality.
 Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.27.2.1  2008/05/02 22:06:10  phase1geo
 Updating arc code for new data structure.  This code is completely untested
 but does compile and has been completely rewritten.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.27  2008/04/15 06:08:46  phase1geo
 First attempt to get both instance and module coverage calculatable for
 GUI purposes.  This is not quite complete at the moment though it does
 compile.

 Revision 1.26  2008/02/09 19:32:44  phase1geo
 Completed first round of modifications for using exception handler.  Regression
 passes with these changes.  Updated regressions per these changes.

 Revision 1.25  2008/02/01 06:37:07  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in genprof.pl.  Added initial code for excluding final blocks and
 using pragma excludes (this code is not fully working yet).  More to be done.

 Revision 1.24  2008/01/16 06:40:33  phase1geo
 More splint updates.

 Revision 1.23  2008/01/16 05:01:21  phase1geo
 Switched totals over from float types to int types for splint purposes.

 Revision 1.22  2008/01/07 23:59:54  phase1geo
 More splint updates.

 Revision 1.21  2008/01/07 05:01:57  phase1geo
 Cleaning up more splint errors.

 Revision 1.20  2008/01/04 23:07:58  phase1geo
 More splint updates.

 Revision 1.19  2007/11/20 05:28:57  phase1geo
 Updating e-mail address from trevorw@charter.net to phase1geo@gmail.com.

 Revision 1.18  2007/09/13 17:03:30  phase1geo
 Cleaning up some const-ness corrections -- still more to go but it's a good
 start.

 Revision 1.17  2006/10/12 22:48:45  phase1geo
 Updates to remove compiler warnings.  Still some work left to go here.

 Revision 1.16  2006/09/20 22:38:09  phase1geo
 Lots of changes to support memories and multi-dimensional arrays.  We still have
 issues with endianness and VCS regressions have not been run, but this is a significant
 amount of work that needs to be checkpointed.

 Revision 1.15  2006/06/29 04:26:02  phase1geo
 More updates for FSM coverage.  We are getting close but are just not to fully
 working order yet.

 Revision 1.14  2006/06/28 22:15:19  phase1geo
 Adding more code to support FSM coverage.  Still a ways to go before this
 is completed.

 Revision 1.13  2006/06/23 19:45:26  phase1geo
 Adding full C support for excluding/including coverage points.  Fixed regression
 suite failures -- full regression now passes.  We just need to start adding support
 to the Tcl/Tk files for full user-specified exclusion support.

 Revision 1.12  2006/04/05 15:19:18  phase1geo
 Adding support for FSM coverage output in the GUI.  Started adding components
 for assertion coverage to GUI and report functions though there is no functional
 support for this at this time.

 Revision 1.11  2006/03/28 22:28:27  phase1geo
 Updates to user guide and added copyright information to each source file in the
 src directory.  Added test directory in user documentation directory containing the
 example used in line, toggle, combinational logic and FSM descriptions.

 Revision 1.10  2004/04/05 12:30:52  phase1geo
 Adding *db_replace functions to allow a design to be opened with new CDD
 results (for GUI purposes only).

 Revision 1.9  2004/03/16 05:45:43  phase1geo
 Checkin contains a plethora of changes, bug fixes, enhancements...
 Some of which include:  new diagnostics to verify bug fixes found in field,
 test generator script for creating new diagnostics, enhancing error reporting
 output to include filename and line number of failing code (useful for error
 regression testing), support for error regression testing, bug fixes for
 segmentation fault errors found in field, additional data integrity features,
 and code support for GUI tool (this submission does not include TCL files).

 Revision 1.8  2004/03/15 21:38:17  phase1geo
 Updated source files after running lint on these files.  Full regression
 still passes at this point.

 Revision 1.7  2003/09/19 13:25:28  phase1geo
 Adding new FSM diagnostics including diagnostics to verify FSM merging function.
 FSM merging code was modified to work correctly.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.6  2003/09/14 01:09:20  phase1geo
 Added verbose output for FSMs.

 Revision 1.5  2003/09/13 19:53:59  phase1geo
 Adding correct way of calculating state and state transition totals.  Modifying
 FSM summary reporting to reflect these changes.  Also added function documentation
 that was missing from last submission.

 Revision 1.4  2003/09/13 02:59:34  phase1geo
 Fixing bugs in arc.c created by extending entry supplemental field to 5 bits
 from 3 bits.  Additional two bits added for calculating unique states.

 Revision 1.3  2003/09/12 04:47:00  phase1geo
 More fixes for new FSM arc transition protocol.  Everything seems to work now
 except that state hits are not being counted correctly.

 Revision 1.2  2003/08/29 12:52:06  phase1geo
 Updating comments for functions.

 Revision 1.1  2003/08/26 12:53:35  phase1geo
 Added initial versions of arc.c and arc.h though they are not even close to
 being finished at this point.
