 $Log$
 Revision 1.47.4.1  2008/07/10 22:43:51  phase1geo
 Merging in rank-devel-branch into this branch.  Added -f options for all commands
 to allow files containing command-line arguments to be added.  A few error diagnostics
 are currently failing due to changes in the rank branch that never got fixed in that
 branch.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.49  2008/06/27 14:02:00  phase1geo
 Fixing splint and -Wextra warnings.  Also fixing comment formatting.

 Revision 1.48  2008/06/19 16:14:54  phase1geo
 leaned up all warnings in source code from -Wall.  This also seems to have cleared
 up a few runtime issues.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.47  2008/04/15 20:37:10  phase1geo
 Fixing database array support.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.46  2008/04/01 23:08:21  phase1geo
 More updates for error diagnostic cleanup.  Full regression still not
 passing (but is getting close).

 Revision 1.45  2008/03/31 18:39:08  phase1geo
 Fixing more regression issues related to latest code modifications.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.44  2008/03/17 22:02:31  phase1geo
 Adding new check_mem script and adding output to perform memory checking during
 regression runs.  Completed work on free_safe and added realloc_safe function
 calls.  Regressions are pretty broke at the moment.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.43  2008/03/17 05:26:16  phase1geo
 Checkpointing.  Things don't compile at the moment.

 Revision 1.42  2008/03/14 22:00:19  phase1geo
 Beginning to instrument code for exception handling verification.  Still have
 a ways to go before we have anything that is self-checking at this point, though.

 Revision 1.41  2008/03/11 22:06:48  phase1geo
 Finishing first round of exception handling code.

 Revision 1.40  2008/03/09 20:45:48  phase1geo
 More exception handling updates.

 Revision 1.39  2008/02/29 00:08:31  phase1geo
 Completed optimization code in simulator.  Still need to verify that code
 changes enhanced performances as desired.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.38  2008/02/25 18:22:16  phase1geo
 Moved statement supplemental bits from root expression to statement and starting
 to add support for race condition checking pragmas (still some work left to do
 on this item).  Updated IV and Cver regressions per these changes.

 Revision 1.37  2008/02/22 20:39:22  phase1geo
 More updates for exception handling.

 Revision 1.36  2008/02/01 06:37:08  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in genprof.pl.  Added initial code for excluding final blocks and
 using pragma excludes (this code is not fully working yet).  More to be done.

 Revision 1.35  2008/01/17 04:35:12  phase1geo
 Updating regression per latest bug fixes and splint updates.

 Revision 1.34  2008/01/16 06:40:37  phase1geo
 More splint updates.

 Revision 1.33  2008/01/10 04:59:04  phase1geo
 More splint updates.  All exportlocal cases are now taken care of.

 Revision 1.32  2008/01/07 23:59:54  phase1geo
 More splint updates.

 Revision 1.31  2007/12/11 05:48:25  phase1geo
 Fixing more compile errors with new code changes and adding more profiling.
 Still have a ways to go before we can compile cleanly again (next submission
 should do it).

 Revision 1.30  2007/11/20 05:28:58  phase1geo
 Updating e-mail address from trevorw@charter.net to phase1geo@gmail.com.

 Revision 1.29  2006/08/18 22:07:45  phase1geo
 Integrating obfuscation into all user-viewable output.  Verified that these
 changes have not made an impact on regressions.  Also improved performance
 impact of not obfuscating output.

 Revision 1.28  2006/07/21 05:47:42  phase1geo
 More code additions for generate functionality.  At this point, we seem to
 be creating proper generate item blocks and are creating the generate loop
 namespace appropriately.  However, the binder is still unable to find a signal
 created by a generate block.

 Revision 1.27  2006/07/20 20:11:09  phase1geo
 More work on generate statements.  Trying to figure out a methodology for
 handling namespaces.  Still a lot of work to go...

 Revision 1.26  2006/07/14 18:53:32  phase1geo
 Fixing -g option for keywords.  This seems to be working and I believe that
 regressions are passing here as well.

 Revision 1.25  2006/04/05 15:19:18  phase1geo
 Adding support for FSM coverage output in the GUI.  Started adding components
 for assertion coverage to GUI and report functions though there is no functional
 support for this at this time.

 Revision 1.24  2006/03/28 22:28:27  phase1geo
 Updates to user guide and added copyright information to each source file in the
 src directory.  Added test directory in user documentation directory containing the
 example used in line, toggle, combinational logic and FSM descriptions.

 Revision 1.23  2006/02/16 21:19:26  phase1geo
 Adding support for arrays of instances.  Also fixing some memory problems for
 constant functions and fixed binding problems when hierarchical references are
 made to merged modules.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.22  2005/12/12 23:25:37  phase1geo
 Fixing memory faults.  This is a work in progress.

 Revision 1.21  2005/11/22 05:30:33  phase1geo
 Updates to regression suite for clearing the assigned bit when a statement
 block is removed from coverage consideration and it is assigning that signal.
 This is not fully working at this point.

 Revision 1.20  2005/11/16 05:41:31  phase1geo
 Fixing implicit signal creation in binding functions.

 Revision 1.19  2005/11/15 23:08:02  phase1geo
 Updates for new binding scheme.  Binding occurs for all expressions, signals,
 FSMs, and functional units after parsing has completed or after database reading
 has been completed.  This should allow for any hierarchical reference or scope
 issues to be handled correctly.  Regression mostly passes but there are still
 a few failures at this point.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.18  2005/11/11 22:53:40  phase1geo
 Updated bind process to allow binding of structures from different hierarchies.
 Added task port signals to get added.

 Revision 1.17  2005/11/08 23:12:09  phase1geo
 Fixes for function/task additions.  Still a lot of testing on these structures;
 however, regressions now pass again so we are checkpointing here.

 Revision 1.16  2005/01/07 17:59:51  phase1geo
 Finalized updates for supplemental field changes.  Everything compiles and links
 correctly at this time; however, a regression run has not confirmed the changes.

 Revision 1.15  2004/03/16 05:45:43  phase1geo
 Checkin contains a plethora of changes, bug fixes, enhancements...
 Some of which include:  new diagnostics to verify bug fixes found in field,
 test generator script for creating new diagnostics, enhancing error reporting
 output to include filename and line number of failing code (useful for error
 regression testing), support for error regression testing, bug fixes for
 segmentation fault errors found in field, additional data integrity features,
 and code support for GUI tool (this submission does not include TCL files).

 Revision 1.14  2004/03/15 21:38:17  phase1geo
 Updated source files after running lint on these files.  Full regression
 still passes at this point.

 Revision 1.13  2003/11/15 04:21:57  phase1geo
 Fixing syntax errors found in Doxygen and GCC compiler.

 Revision 1.12  2003/11/11 21:48:09  phase1geo
 Fixing bug where next pointers in bind lists were not being initialized to
 NULL (manifested itself in Irix).  Also added missing development documentation
 to functions in fsm_var.c and removed unnecessary function.

 Revision 1.11  2003/11/11 13:38:00  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in fsm_var that bound FSM statements early.  This caused an
 incorrect ordering of statements that results in incorrect FSM coverage.
 Updated regression suite for changes.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.10  2003/11/07 05:18:40  phase1geo
 Adding working code for inline FSM attribute handling.  Full regression fails
 at this point but the code seems to be working correctly.

 Revision 1.9  2003/10/28 01:09:38  phase1geo
 Cleaning up unnecessary output.

 Revision 1.8  2003/10/28 00:18:06  phase1geo
 Adding initial support for inline attributes to specify FSMs.  Still more
 work to go but full regression still passes at this point.

 Revision 1.7  2003/10/20 21:38:49  phase1geo
 Adding function documentation to functions that were missing it.

 Revision 1.6  2003/10/16 04:26:01  phase1geo
 Adding new fsm5 diagnostic to testsuite and regression.  Added proper support
 for FSM variables that are not able to be bound correctly.  Fixing bug in
 signal_from_string function.

 Revision 1.5  2003/10/14 04:02:44  phase1geo
 Final fixes for new FSM support.  Full regression now passes.  Need to
 add new diagnostics to verify new functionality, but at least all existing
 cases are supported again.

 Revision 1.4  2003/10/13 12:27:25  phase1geo
 More fixes to FSM stuff.

 Revision 1.3  2003/10/13 03:56:29  phase1geo
 Fixing some problems with new FSM code.  Not quite there yet.

 Revision 1.2  2003/10/10 20:52:07  phase1geo
 Initial submission of FSM expression allowance code.  We are still not quite
 there yet, but we are getting close.

 Revision 1.1  2003/10/03 21:28:43  phase1geo
 Restructuring FSM handling to be better suited to handle new FSM input/output
 state variable allowances.  Regression should still pass but new FSM support
 is not supported.
