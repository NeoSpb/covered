 Revision 1.89.4.1  2008/07/10 22:43:52  phase1geo
 Merging in rank-devel-branch into this branch.  Added -f options for all commands
 to allow files containing command-line arguments to be added.  A few error diagnostics
 are currently failing due to changes in the rank branch that never got fixed in that
 branch.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.92  2008/06/27 14:02:02  phase1geo
 Fixing splint and -Wextra warnings.  Also fixing comment formatting.

 Revision 1.91  2008/06/22 05:08:40  phase1geo
 Fixing memory testing error in tcl_funcs.c.  Removed unnecessary output in main_view.tcl.
 Added a few more report diagnostics and started to remove width report files (these will
 no longer be needed and will improve regression runtime and diagnostic memory footprint.

 Revision 1.90  2008/06/19 16:14:55  phase1geo
 leaned up all warnings in source code from -Wall.  This also seems to have cleared
 up a few runtime issues.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.89  2008/04/15 20:37:11  phase1geo
 Fixing database array support.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.88  2008/03/17 22:02:31  phase1geo
 Adding new check_mem script and adding output to perform memory checking during
 regression runs.  Completed work on free_safe and added realloc_safe function
 calls.  Regressions are pretty broke at the moment.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.87  2008/03/17 05:26:16  phase1geo
 Checkpointing.  Things don't compile at the moment.

 Revision 1.86  2008/03/14 05:20:49  phase1geo
 Fixing line.c and updating regressions as necessary.

 Revision 1.85  2008/02/25 18:22:16  phase1geo
 Moved statement supplemental bits from root expression to statement and starting
 to add support for race condition checking pragmas (still some work left to do
 on this item).  Updated IV and Cver regressions per these changes.

 Revision 1.84  2008/02/22 16:40:00  phase1geo
 Fixing bug 1899735.

 Revision 1.83  2008/01/16 06:40:37  phase1geo
 More splint updates.

 Revision 1.82  2008/01/16 05:01:22  phase1geo
 Switched totals over from float types to int types for splint purposes.

 Revision 1.81  2008/01/10 04:59:04  phase1geo
 More splint updates.  All exportlocal cases are now taken care of.

 Revision 1.80  2008/01/07 23:59:55  phase1geo
 More splint updates.

 Revision 1.79  2007/12/11 05:48:25  phase1geo
 Fixing more compile errors with new code changes and adding more profiling.
 Still have a ways to go before we can compile cleanly again (next submission
 should do it).

 Revision 1.78  2007/11/20 05:28:58  phase1geo
 Updating e-mail address from trevorw@charter.net to phase1geo@gmail.com.

 Revision 1.77  2007/09/13 17:03:30  phase1geo
 Cleaning up some const-ness corrections -- still more to go but it's a good
 start.

 Revision 1.76  2007/07/26 22:23:00  phase1geo
 Starting to work on the functionality for automatic tasks/functions.  Just
 checkpointing some work.

 Revision 1.75  2007/07/16 18:39:59  phase1geo
 Finishing adding accumulated coverage output to report files.  Also fixed
 compiler warnings with static values in C code that are inputs to 64-bit
 variables.  Full regression was not run with these changes due to pre-existing
 simulator problems in core code.

 Revision 1.74  2007/07/16 12:39:33  phase1geo
 Started to add support for displaying accumulated coverage results for
 each metric.  Finished line and toggle and am half-way done with memory
 coverage (still have combinational logic, FSM and assertion coverage
 to complete before this feature is fully functional).

 Revision 1.73  2007/04/03 18:55:57  phase1geo
 Fixing more bugs in reporting mechanisms for unnamed scopes.  Checking in more
 regression updates per these changes.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.72  2007/04/03 04:15:17  phase1geo
 Fixing bugs in func_iter functionality.  Modified functional unit name
 flattening function (though this does not appear to be working correctly
 at this time).  Added calls to funit_flatten_name in all of the reporting
 files.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.71  2007/04/02 20:19:36  phase1geo
 Checkpointing more work on use of functional iterators.  Not working correctly
 yet.

 Revision 1.70  2007/04/02 04:50:04  phase1geo
 Adding func_iter files to iterate through a functional unit for reporting
 purposes.  Updated affected files.

 Revision 1.69  2007/03/30 22:43:13  phase1geo
 Regression fixes.  Still have a ways to go but we are getting close.

 Revision 1.68  2006/10/12 22:48:46  phase1geo
 Updates to remove compiler warnings.  Still some work left to go here.

 Revision 1.67  2006/09/01 23:06:02  phase1geo
 Fixing regressions per latest round of changes.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.66  2006/09/01 04:06:37  phase1geo
 Added code to support more than one instance tree.  Currently, I am seeing
 quite a few memory errors that are causing some major problems at the moment.
 Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.65  2006/08/22 21:46:03  phase1geo
 Updating from stable branch.

 Revision 1.64  2006/08/18 22:07:45  phase1geo
 Integrating obfuscation into all user-viewable output.  Verified that these
 changes have not made an impact on regressions.  Also improved performance
 impact of not obfuscating output.

 Revision 1.63  2006/06/29 20:57:24  phase1geo
 Added stmt_excluded bit to expression to allow us to individually control line
 and combinational logic exclusion.  This also allows us to exclude combinational
 logic within excluded lines.  Also fixing problem with highlighting the listbox
 (due to recent changes).

 Revision 1.62  2006/06/26 04:12:55  phase1geo
 More updates for supporting coverage exclusion.  Still a bit more to go
 before this is working properly.

 Revision 1.61  2006/06/22 21:56:21  phase1geo
 Adding excluded bits to signal and arc structures and changed statistic gathering
 functions to not gather coverage for excluded structures.  Started to work on
 exclude.c file which will quickly adjust coverage information from GUI modifications.
 Regression has been updated for this change and it fully passes.

 Revision 1.60  2006/04/19 22:21:33  phase1geo
 More updates to properly support assertion coverage.  Removing assertion modules
 from line, toggle, combinational logic, FSM and race condition output so that there
 won't be any overlap of information here.

 Revision 1.59  2006/04/18 21:59:54  phase1geo
 Adding support for environment variable substitution in configuration files passed
 to the score command.  Adding ovl.c/ovl.h files.  Working on support for assertion
 coverage in report command.  Still have a bit to go here yet.

 Revision 1.58  2006/04/11 22:42:16  phase1geo
 First pass at adding multi-file merging.  Still need quite a bit of work here yet.

 Revision 1.57  2006/03/28 22:28:27  phase1geo
 Updates to user guide and added copyright information to each source file in the
 src directory.  Added test directory in user documentation directory containing the
 example used in line, toggle, combinational logic and FSM descriptions.

 Revision 1.56  2006/03/27 23:25:30  phase1geo
 Updating development documentation for 0.4 stable release.

 Revision 1.55  2006/02/17 19:50:47  phase1geo
 Added full support for escaped names.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.54  2005/12/31 05:00:57  phase1geo
 Updating regression due to recent changes in adding exec_num field in expression
 and removing the executed bit in the expression supplemental field.  This will eventually
 allow us to get information on where the simulator is spending the most time.

 Revision 1.53  2005/12/06 15:42:11  phase1geo
 Added disable2.1 diagnostic to regression suite.  Fixed bad output from line
 coverage reports.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.52  2005/11/30 18:25:56  phase1geo
 Fixing named block code.  Full regression now passes.  Still more work to do on
 named blocks, however.

 Revision 1.51  2005/11/10 23:27:37  phase1geo
 Adding scope files to handle scope searching.  The functions are complete (not
 debugged) but are not as of yet used anywhere in the code.  Added new func2 diagnostic
 which brings out scoping issues for functions.

 Revision 1.50  2005/11/10 19:28:23  phase1geo
 Updates/fixes for tasks/functions.  Also updated Tcl/Tk scripts for these changes.
 Fixed bug with net_decl_assign statements -- the line, start column and end column
 information was incorrect, causing problems with the GUI output.

 Revision 1.49  2005/11/08 23:12:09  phase1geo
 Fixes for function/task additions.  Still a lot of testing on these structures;
 however, regressions now pass again so we are checkpointing here.

 Revision 1.48  2005/02/05 05:29:25  phase1geo
 Added race condition reporting to GUI.

 Revision 1.47  2005/01/07 17:59:51  phase1geo
 Finalized updates for supplemental field changes.  Everything compiles and links
 correctly at this time; however, a regression run has not confirmed the changes.

 Revision 1.46  2004/08/11 22:11:39  phase1geo
 Initial beginnings of combinational logic verbose reporting to GUI.

 Revision 1.45  2004/08/08 12:50:27  phase1geo
 Snapshot of addition of toggle coverage in GUI.  This is not working exactly as
 it will be, but it is getting close.

 Revision 1.44  2004/04/01 22:54:38  phase1geo
 Making text field read-only.  Adding message when reading in new CDD files
 (as status information -- this is not working correctly yet).  Fixing bug
 in line.c when getting total lines summary information.

 Revision 1.43  2004/03/16 05:45:43  phase1geo
 Checkin contains a plethora of changes, bug fixes, enhancements...
 Some of which include:  new diagnostics to verify bug fixes found in field,
 test generator script for creating new diagnostics, enhancing error reporting
 output to include filename and line number of failing code (useful for error
 regression testing), support for error regression testing, bug fixes for
 segmentation fault errors found in field, additional data integrity features,
 and code support for GUI tool (this submission does not include TCL files).

 Revision 1.42  2004/03/15 21:38:17  phase1geo
 Updated source files after running lint on these files.  Full regression
 still passes at this point.

 Revision 1.41  2004/01/31 18:58:43  phase1geo
 Finished reformatting of reports.  Fixed bug where merged reports with
 different leading hierarchies were outputting the leading hierarchy of one
 which lead to confusion when interpreting reports.  Also made modification
 to information line in CDD file for these cases.  Full regression runs clean
 with Icarus Verilog at this point.

 Revision 1.40  2004/01/30 23:23:27  phase1geo
 More report output improvements.  Still not ready with regressions.

 Revision 1.39  2004/01/30 06:04:45  phase1geo
 More report output format tweaks.  Adjusted lines and spaces to make things
 look more organized.  Still some more to go.  Regression will fail at this
 point.

 Revision 1.38  2004/01/23 14:37:09  phase1geo
 Fixing output of instance line, toggle, comb and fsm to only output module
 name if logic is detected missing in that instance.  Full regression fails
 with this fix.

 Revision 1.37  2003/12/12 17:16:25  phase1geo
 Changing code generator to output logic based on user supplied format.  Full
 regression fails at this point due to mismatching report files.

 Revision 1.36  2003/12/02 22:38:06  phase1geo
 Removing unnecessary verbosity.

 Revision 1.35  2003/12/01 23:27:16  phase1geo
 Adding code for retrieving line summary module coverage information for
 GUI.

 Revision 1.34  2003/11/30 21:50:45  phase1geo
 Modifying line_collect_uncovered function to create array containing all physical
 lines (rather than just uncovered statement starting line values) for more
 accurate line coverage results for the GUI.  Added new long_exp2 diagnostic that
 is used to test this functionality.

 Revision 1.33  2003/11/22 20:44:58  phase1geo
 Adding function to get array of missed line numbers for GUI purposes.  Updates
 to report command for getting information ready when running the GUI.

 Revision 1.32  2003/10/13 03:56:29  phase1geo
 Fixing some problems with new FSM code.  Not quite there yet.

 Revision 1.31  2003/10/03 12:31:04  phase1geo
 More report tweaking.

 Revision 1.30  2003/10/03 03:08:44  phase1geo
 Modifying filename in summary output to only specify basename of file instead
 of entire path.  The verbose report contains the full pathname still, however.

 Revision 1.29  2003/08/25 13:02:03  phase1geo
 Initial stab at adding FSM support.  Contains summary reporting capability
 at this point and roughly works.  Updated regress suite as a result of these
 changes.

 Revision 1.28  2003/02/23 23:32:36  phase1geo
 Updates to provide better cross-platform compiler support.

 Revision 1.27  2003/02/17 22:47:20  phase1geo
 Fixing bug with merging same DUTs from different testbenches.  Updated reports
 to display full path instead of instance name and parent instance name.  Added
 merge tests and added merge testing into regression test suite.  Fixing bug with
 -D/-Q option specified with merge command.  Full regression passing.

 Revision 1.26  2002/12/07 17:46:53  phase1geo
 Fixing bug with handling memory declarations.  Added diagnostic to verify
 that memory declarations are handled properly.  Fixed bug with infinite
 looping in statement_connect function and optimized this part of the score
 command.  Added diagnostic to verify this fix (always9.v).  Fixed bug in
 report command with ordering of lines and combinational logic verbose output.
 This is now fixed correctly.

 Revision 1.25  2002/11/02 16:16:20  phase1geo
 Cleaned up all compiler warnings in source and header files.

 Revision 1.24  2002/10/29 19:57:50  phase1geo
 Fixing problems with beginning block comments within comments which are
 produced automatically by CVS.  Should fix warning messages from compiler.

 Revision 1.23  2002/10/29 13:33:21  phase1geo
 Adding patches for 64-bit compatibility.  Reformatted parser.y for easier
 viewing (removed tabs).  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.22  2002/10/25 13:43:49  phase1geo
 Adding statement iterators for moving in both directions in a list with a single
 pointer (two-way).  This allows us to reverse statement lists without additional
 memory and time (very efficient).  Full regression passes and TODO list items
 2 and 3 are completed.

 Revision 1.21  2002/10/24 23:19:39  phase1geo
 Making some fixes to report output.  Fixing bugs.  Added long_exp1.v diagnostic
 to regression suite which finds a current bug in the report underlining
 functionality.  Need to look into this.

 Revision 1.20  2002/09/13 05:12:25  phase1geo
 Adding final touches to -d option to report.  Adding documentation and
 updating development documentation to stay in sync.

 Revision 1.19  2002/09/10 05:40:09  phase1geo
 Adding support for MULTIPLY, DIVIDE and MOD in expression verbose display.
 Fixing cases where -c option was not generating covered information in
 line and combination report output.  Updates to assign1.v diagnostic for
 logic that is now supported by both Covered and IVerilog.  Updated assign1.cdd
 to account for correct coverage file for the updated assign1.v diagnostic.

 Revision 1.18  2002/08/20 04:48:18  phase1geo
 Adding option to report command that allows the user to display logic that is
 being covered (-c option).  This overrides the default behavior of displaying
 uncovered logic.  This is useful for debugging purposes and understanding what
 logic the tool is capable of handling.

 Revision 1.17  2002/08/19 04:59:49  phase1geo
 Adjusting summary format to allow for larger line, toggle and combination
 counts.

 Revision 1.16  2002/07/20 18:46:38  phase1geo
 Causing fully covered modules to not be output in reports.  Adding
 instance3.v diagnostic to verify this works correctly.

 Revision 1.15  2002/07/14 05:27:34  phase1geo
 Fixing report outputting to allow multiple modules/instances to be
 output.

 Revision 1.14  2002/07/10 13:15:57  phase1geo
 Adding case1.1.v Verilog diagnostic to check default case statement.  There
 were reporting problems related to this.  Report problems have been fixed and
 full regression passes.

 Revision 1.13  2002/07/09 03:24:48  phase1geo
 Various fixes for module instantiantion handling.  This now works.  Also
 modified report output for toggle, line and combinational information.
 Regression passes.

 Revision 1.12  2002/07/05 05:00:14  phase1geo
 Removing CASE, CASEX, and CASEZ from line and combinational logic results.

 Revision 1.11  2002/07/02 19:52:50  phase1geo
 Removing unecessary diagnostics.  Cleaning up extraneous output and
 generating new documentation from source.  Regression passes at the
 current time.

 Revision 1.10  2002/06/27 20:39:43  phase1geo
 Fixing scoring bugs as well as report bugs.  Things are starting to work
 fairly well now.  Added rest of support for delays.

 Revision 1.9  2002/06/25 21:46:10  phase1geo
 Fixes to simulator and reporting.  Still some bugs here.

 Revision 1.8  2002/06/22 05:27:30  phase1geo
 Additional supporting code for simulation engine and statement support in
 parser.

 Revision 1.7  2002/05/13 03:02:58  phase1geo
 Adding lines back to expressions and removing them from statements (since the line
 number range of an expression can be calculated by looking at the expression line
 numbers).
