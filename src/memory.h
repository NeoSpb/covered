 $Log$
 Revision 1.10.6.3  2008/08/07 06:39:11  phase1geo
 Adding "Excluded" column to the summary listbox.

 Revision 1.10.6.2  2008/08/06 20:11:34  phase1geo
 Adding support for instance-based coverage reporting in GUI.  Everything seems to be
 working except for proper exclusion handling.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.10.6.1  2008/07/10 22:43:52  phase1geo
 Merging in rank-devel-branch into this branch.  Added -f options for all commands
 to allow files containing command-line arguments to be added.  A few error diagnostics
 are currently failing due to changes in the rank branch that never got fixed in that
 branch.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.11  2008/06/27 14:02:03  phase1geo
 Fixing splint and -Wextra warnings.  Also fixing comment formatting.

 Revision 1.10  2008/01/30 05:51:50  phase1geo
 Fixing doxygen errors.  Updated parameter list syntax to make it more readable.

 Revision 1.9  2008/01/16 05:01:23  phase1geo
 Switched totals over from float types to int types for splint purposes.

 Revision 1.8  2008/01/07 23:59:55  phase1geo
 More splint updates.

 Revision 1.7  2007/11/20 05:28:59  phase1geo
 Updating e-mail address from trevorw@charter.net to phase1geo@gmail.com.

 Revision 1.6  2006/10/06 22:45:57  phase1geo
 Added support for the wait() statement.  Added wait1 diagnostic to regression
 suite to verify its behavior.  Also added missing GPL license note at the top
 of several *.h and *.c files that are somewhat new.

 Revision 1.5  2006/10/02 22:41:00  phase1geo
 Lots of bug fixes to memory coverage functionality for GUI.  Memory coverage
 should now be working correctly.  We just need to update the GUI documentation
 as well as other images for the new feature add.

 Revision 1.4  2006/09/27 21:38:35  phase1geo
 Adding code to interract with data in memory coverage verbose window.  Majority
 of code is in place; however, this has not been thoroughly debugged at this point.
 Adding mem3 diagnostic for GUI debugging purposes and checkpointing.

 Revision 1.3  2006/09/26 22:36:38  phase1geo
 Adding code for memory coverage to GUI and related files.  Lots of work to go
 here so we are checkpointing for the moment.

 Revision 1.2  2006/09/25 22:22:28  phase1geo
 Adding more support for memory reporting to both score and report commands.
 We are getting closer; however, regressions are currently broken.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.1  2006/09/25 04:15:04  phase1geo
 Starting to add support for new memory coverage metric.  This includes changes
 for the report command only at this point.
