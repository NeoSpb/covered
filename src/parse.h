 $Log$
 Revision 1.7  2006/01/25 22:13:46  phase1geo
 Adding LXT-style dumpfile parsing support.  Everything is wired in but I still
 need to look at a problem at the end of the dumpfile -- I'm getting coredumps
 when using the new -lxt option.  I also need to disable LXT code if the z
 library is missing along with documenting the new feature in the user's guide
 and man page.

 Revision 1.6  2002/11/05 00:20:07  phase1geo
 Adding development documentation.  Fixing problem with combinational logic
 output in report command and updating full regression.

 Revision 1.5  2002/10/31 23:14:13  phase1geo
 Fixing C compatibility problems with cc and gcc.  Found a few possible problems
 with 64-bit vs. 32-bit compilation of the tool.  Fixed bug in parser that
 lead to bus errors.  Ran full regression in 64-bit mode without error.

 Revision 1.4  2002/10/29 19:57:51  phase1geo
 Fixing problems with beginning block comments within comments which are
 produced automatically by CVS.  Should fix warning messages from compiler.

 Revision 1.3  2002/07/20 21:34:58  phase1geo
 Separating ability to parse design and score dumpfile.  Now both or either
 can be done (allowing one to parse once and score multiple times).

 Revision 1.2  2002/07/03 03:31:11  phase1geo
 Adding RCS Log strings in files that were missing them so that file version
 information is contained in every source and header file.  Reordering src
 Makefile to be alphabetical.  Adding mult1.v diagnostic to regression suite.
