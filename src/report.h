 $Log$
 Revision 1.8  2006/03/28 22:28:28  phase1geo
 Updates to user guide and added copyright information to each source file in the
 src directory.  Added test directory in user documentation directory containing the
 example used in line, toggle, combinational logic and FSM descriptions.

 Revision 1.7  2005/02/05 04:13:30  phase1geo
 Started to add reporting capabilities for race condition information.  Modified
 race condition reason calculation and handling.  Ran -Wall on all code and cleaned
 things up.  Cleaned up regression as a result of these changes.  Full regression
 now passes.

 Revision 1.6  2002/11/05 00:20:08  phase1geo
 Adding development documentation.  Fixing problem with combinational logic
 output in report command and updating full regression.

 Revision 1.5  2002/10/31 23:14:18  phase1geo
 Fixing C compatibility problems with cc and gcc.  Found a few possible problems
 with 64-bit vs. 32-bit compilation of the tool.  Fixed bug in parser that
 lead to bus errors.  Ran full regression in 64-bit mode without error.

 Revision 1.4  2002/10/29 19:57:51  phase1geo
 Fixing problems with beginning block comments within comments which are
 produced automatically by CVS.  Should fix warning messages from compiler.

 Revision 1.3  2002/07/09 04:46:26  phase1geo
 Adding -D and -Q options to covered for outputting debug information or
 suppressing normal output entirely.  Updated generated documentation and
 modified Verilog diagnostic Makefile to use these new options.

 Revision 1.2  2002/07/03 03:31:11  phase1geo
 Adding RCS Log strings in files that were missing them so that file version
 information is contained in every source and header file.  Reordering src
 Makefile to be alphabetical.  Adding mult1.v diagnostic to regression suite.
