 $Log$
 Revision 1.14.6.1  2008/07/10 22:43:53  phase1geo
 Merging in rank-devel-branch into this branch.  Added -f options for all commands
 to allow files containing command-line arguments to be added.  A few error diagnostics
 are currently failing due to changes in the rank branch that never got fixed in that
 branch.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.15  2008/06/27 14:02:03  phase1geo
 Fixing splint and -Wextra warnings.  Also fixing comment formatting.

 Revision 1.14  2008/01/16 05:01:23  phase1geo
 Switched totals over from float types to int types for splint purposes.

 Revision 1.13  2008/01/10 04:59:04  phase1geo
 More splint updates.  All exportlocal cases are now taken care of.

 Revision 1.12  2008/01/08 13:27:46  phase1geo
 More splint updates.

 Revision 1.11  2007/11/20 05:28:59  phase1geo
 Updating e-mail address from trevorw@charter.net to phase1geo@gmail.com.

 Revision 1.10  2007/09/13 17:03:30  phase1geo
 Cleaning up some const-ness corrections -- still more to go but it's a good
 start.

 Revision 1.9  2006/06/29 20:06:33  phase1geo
 Adding assertion exclusion code.  Things seem to be working properly with this
 now.  This concludes the initial version of code exclusion.  There are some
 things to clean up (and maybe make better looking).

 Revision 1.8  2006/06/23 19:45:27  phase1geo
 Adding full C support for excluding/including coverage points.  Fixed regression
 suite failures -- full regression now passes.  We just need to start adding support
 to the Tcl/Tk files for full user-specified exclusion support.

 Revision 1.7  2006/05/01 22:27:37  phase1geo
 More updates with assertion coverage window.  Still have a ways to go.

 Revision 1.6  2006/05/01 13:19:07  phase1geo
 Enhancing the verbose assertion window.  Still need to fix a few bugs and add
 a few more enhancements.

 Revision 1.5  2006/04/29 05:12:14  phase1geo
 Adding initial version of assertion verbose window.  This is currently working; however,
 I think that I want to enhance this window a bit more before calling it good.

 Revision 1.4  2006/04/28 17:10:19  phase1geo
 Adding GUI support for assertion coverage.  Halfway there.

 Revision 1.3  2006/04/21 22:03:58  phase1geo
 Adding ovl1 and ovl1.1 diagnostics to testsuite.  ovl1 passes while ovl1.1
 currently fails due to a problem with outputting parameters to the CDD file
 (need to look into this further).  Added OVL assertion verbose output support
 which seems to be working for the moment.

 Revision 1.2  2006/04/19 22:21:33  phase1geo
 More updates to properly support assertion coverage.  Removing assertion modules
 from line, toggle, combinational logic, FSM and race condition output so that there
 won't be any overlap of information here.

 Revision 1.1  2006/04/18 21:59:54  phase1geo
 Adding support for environment variable substitution in configuration files passed
 to the score command.  Adding ovl.c/ovl.h files.  Working on support for assertion
 coverage in report command.  Still have a bit to go here yet.
