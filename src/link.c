 $Log$
 Revision 1.79.4.1  2008/07/10 22:43:52  phase1geo
 Merging in rank-devel-branch into this branch.  Added -f options for all commands
 to allow files containing command-line arguments to be added.  A few error diagnostics
 are currently failing due to changes in the rank branch that never got fixed in that
 branch.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.80.2.1  2008/06/30 23:02:42  phase1geo
 More work on the rank command.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.80  2008/06/27 14:02:02  phase1geo
 Fixing splint and -Wextra warnings.  Also fixing comment formatting.

 Revision 1.79  2008/04/15 06:08:47  phase1geo
 First attempt to get both instance and module coverage calculatable for
 GUI purposes.  This is not quite complete at the moment though it does
 compile.

 Revision 1.78  2008/04/06 05:46:54  phase1geo
 Another regression memory deallocation fix.  Updates to regression files.

 Revision 1.77  2008/03/17 05:26:16  phase1geo
 Checkpointing.  Things don't compile at the moment.

 Revision 1.76  2008/02/25 18:22:16  phase1geo
 Moved statement supplemental bits from root expression to statement and starting
 to add support for race condition checking pragmas (still some work left to do
 on this item).  Updated IV and Cver regressions per these changes.

 Revision 1.75  2008/01/30 05:51:50  phase1geo
 Fixing doxygen errors.  Updated parameter list syntax to make it more readable.

 Revision 1.74  2008/01/09 05:22:21  phase1geo
 More splint updates using the -standard option.

 Revision 1.73  2008/01/08 21:13:08  phase1geo
 Completed -weak splint run.  Full regressions pass.

 Revision 1.72  2008/01/07 23:59:55  phase1geo
 More splint updates.

 Revision 1.71  2007/12/18 23:55:21  phase1geo
 Starting to remove 64-bit time and replacing it with a sim_time structure
 for performance enhancement purposes.  Also removing global variables for time-related
 information and passing this information around by reference for performance
 enhancement purposes.

 Revision 1.70  2007/12/12 07:23:19  phase1geo
 More work on profiling.  I have now included the ability to get function runtimes.
 Still more work to do but everything is currently working at the moment.

 Revision 1.69  2007/12/11 05:48:25  phase1geo
 Fixing more compile errors with new code changes and adding more profiling.
 Still have a ways to go before we can compile cleanly again (next submission
 should do it).

 Revision 1.68  2007/11/20 05:28:58  phase1geo
 Updating e-mail address from trevorw@charter.net to phase1geo@gmail.com.

 Revision 1.67  2007/09/13 17:03:30  phase1geo
 Cleaning up some const-ness corrections -- still more to go but it's a good
 start.

 Revision 1.66  2007/09/05 21:07:37  phase1geo
 Fixing bug 1788991.  Full regression passes.  Removed excess output used for
 debugging.  May want to create a new development release with these changes.

 Revision 1.65  2007/09/04 22:50:50  phase1geo
 Fixed static_afunc1 issues.  Reran regressions and updated necessary files.
 Also working on debugging one remaining issue with mem1.v (not solved yet).

 Revision 1.64  2007/04/18 22:35:02  phase1geo
 Revamping simulator core again.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.63  2007/04/10 22:10:11  phase1geo
 Fixing some more simulation issues.

 Revision 1.62  2007/04/09 22:47:53  phase1geo
 Starting to modify the simulation engine for performance purposes.  Code is
 not complete and is untested at this point.

 Revision 1.61  2007/03/20 04:29:32  phase1geo
 Fixing bugs in new stmt_link_merge function.  Updated regressions (only 11
 diagnostics are currently failing in IV regression).  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.60  2007/03/19 22:52:50  phase1geo
 Attempting to fix problem with line ordering for a named block that is
 in the middle of another statement block.  Also fixed a problem with FORK
 expressions not being bound early enough.  Run currently segfaults but
 I need to checkpoint at the moment.

 Revision 1.59  2007/03/15 22:39:05  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in unnamed scope binding.

 Revision 1.58  2006/12/19 05:23:39  phase1geo
 Added initial code for handling instance flattening for unnamed scopes.  This
 is partially working at this point but still needs some debugging.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.57  2006/10/09 17:54:19  phase1geo
 Fixing support for VPI to allow it to properly get linked to the simulator.
 Also fixed inconsistency in generate reports and updated appropriately in
 regressions for this change.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.56  2006/09/01 23:06:02  phase1geo
 Fixing regressions per latest round of changes.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.55  2006/09/01 04:06:37  phase1geo
 Added code to support more than one instance tree.  Currently, I am seeing
 quite a few memory errors that are causing some major problems at the moment.
 Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.54  2006/08/28 22:28:28  phase1geo
 Fixing bug 1546059 to match stable branch.  Adding support for repeated delay
 expressions (i.e., a = repeat(2) @(b) c).  Fixing support for event delayed
 assignments (i.e., a = @(b) c).  Adding several new diagnostics to verify this
 new level of support and updating regressions for these changes.  Also added
 parser support for logic port types.

 Revision 1.53  2006/08/18 22:07:45  phase1geo
 Integrating obfuscation into all user-viewable output.  Verified that these
 changes have not made an impact on regressions.  Also improved performance
 impact of not obfuscating output.

 Revision 1.52  2006/08/02 22:28:32  phase1geo
 Attempting to fix the bug pulled out by generate11.v.  We are just having an issue
 with setting the assigned bit in a signal expression that contains a hierarchical reference
 using a genvar reference.  Adding generate11.1 diagnostic to verify a slightly different
 syntax style for the same code.  Note sure how badly I broke regression at this point.

 Revision 1.51  2006/07/29 20:53:43  phase1geo
 Fixing some code related to generate statements; however, generate8.1 is still
 not completely working at this point.  Full regression passes for IV.

 Revision 1.50  2006/07/21 05:47:42  phase1geo
 More code additions for generate functionality.  At this point, we seem to
 be creating proper generate item blocks and are creating the generate loop
 namespace appropriately.  However, the binder is still unable to find a signal
 created by a generate block.

 Revision 1.49  2006/07/17 22:12:42  phase1geo
 Adding more code for generate block support.  Still just adding code at this
 point -- hopefully I haven't broke anything that doesn't use generate blocks.

 Revision 1.48  2006/07/14 18:53:32  phase1geo
 Fixing -g option for keywords.  This seems to be working and I believe that
 regressions are passing here as well.

 Revision 1.47  2006/07/13 22:24:57  phase1geo
 We are really broke at this time; however, more code has been added to support
 the -g score option.

 Revision 1.46  2006/07/09 01:40:39  phase1geo
 Removing the vpi directory (again).  Also fixing a bug in Covered's expression
 deallocator where a case statement contains an unbindable signal.  Previously
 the case test expression was being deallocated twice.  This submission fixes
 this bug (bug was also fixed in the 0.4.5 stable release).  Added new tests
 to verify fix.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.45  2006/06/29 20:06:33  phase1geo
 Adding assertion exclusion code.  Things seem to be working properly with this
 now.  This concludes the initial version of code exclusion.  There are some
 things to clean up (and maybe make better looking).

 Revision 1.44  2006/06/23 19:45:27  phase1geo
 Adding full C support for excluding/including coverage points.  Fixed regression
 suite failures -- full regression now passes.  We just need to start adding support
 to the Tcl/Tk files for full user-specified exclusion support.

 Revision 1.43  2006/03/28 22:28:27  phase1geo
 Updates to user guide and added copyright information to each source file in the
 src directory.  Added test directory in user documentation directory containing the
 example used in line, toggle, combinational logic and FSM descriptions.

 Revision 1.42  2006/02/17 19:50:47  phase1geo
 Added full support for escaped names.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.41  2006/02/16 21:19:26  phase1geo
 Adding support for arrays of instances.  Also fixing some memory problems for
 constant functions and fixed binding problems when hierarchical references are
 made to merged modules.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.40  2006/01/19 23:10:38  phase1geo
 Adding line and starting column information to vsignal structure (and associated CDD
 files).  Regression has been fully updated for this change which now fully passes.  Final
 changes to summary GUI.  Fixed signal underlining for toggle coverage to work for both
 explicit and implicit signals.  Getting things ready for a preferences window.

 Revision 1.39  2005/12/19 05:18:24  phase1geo
 Fixing memory leak problems with instance1.1.  Full regression has some segfaults
 that need to be looked at now.

 Revision 1.38  2005/12/14 23:03:24  phase1geo
 More updates to remove memory faults.  Still a work in progress but full
 regression passes.

 Revision 1.37  2005/11/22 16:46:27  phase1geo
 Fixed bug with clearing the assigned bit in the binding phase.  Full regression
 now runs cleanly.

 Revision 1.36  2005/11/22 05:30:33  phase1geo
 Updates to regression suite for clearing the assigned bit when a statement
 block is removed from coverage consideration and it is assigning that signal.
 This is not fully working at this point.

 Revision 1.35  2005/11/21 04:17:43  phase1geo
 More updates to regression suite -- includes several bug fixes.  Also added --enable-debug
 facility to configuration file which will include or exclude debugging output from being
 generated.

 Revision 1.34  2005/11/08 23:12:09  phase1geo
 Fixes for function/task additions.  Still a lot of testing on these structures;
 however, regressions now pass again so we are checkpointing here.

 Revision 1.33  2005/01/25 13:42:27  phase1geo
 Fixing segmentation fault problem with race condition checking.  Added race1.1
 to regression.  Removed unnecessary output statements from previous debugging
 checkins.

 Revision 1.32  2005/01/24 13:21:45  phase1geo
 Modifying unlinking algorithm for statement links.  Still getting
 segmentation fault at this time.

 Revision 1.31  2005/01/11 14:24:16  phase1geo
 Intermediate checkin.

 Revision 1.30  2005/01/10 23:03:39  phase1geo
 Added code to properly report race conditions.  Added code to remove statement blocks
 from module when race conditions are found.

 Revision 1.29  2005/01/07 17:59:52  phase1geo
 Finalized updates for supplemental field changes.  Everything compiles and links
 correctly at this time; however, a regression run has not confirmed the changes.

 Revision 1.28  2004/07/22 04:43:06  phase1geo
 Finishing code to calculate start and end columns of expressions.  Regression
 has been updated for these changes.  Other various minor changes as well.

 Revision 1.27  2004/03/30 15:42:14  phase1geo
 Renaming signal type to vsignal type to eliminate compilation problems on systems
 that contain a signal type in the OS.

 Revision 1.26  2004/03/16 05:45:43  phase1geo
 Checkin contains a plethora of changes, bug fixes, enhancements...
 Some of which include:  new diagnostics to verify bug fixes found in field,
 test generator script for creating new diagnostics, enhancing error reporting
 output to include filename and line number of failing code (useful for error
 regression testing), support for error regression testing, bug fixes for
 segmentation fault errors found in field, additional data integrity features,
 and code support for GUI tool (this submission does not include TCL files).

 Revision 1.25  2004/03/15 21:38:17  phase1geo
 Updated source files after running lint on these files.  Full regression
 still passes at this point.

 Revision 1.24  2003/10/28 00:18:06  phase1geo
 Adding initial support for inline attributes to specify FSMs.  Still more
 work to go but full regression still passes at this point.

 Revision 1.23  2003/10/13 03:56:29  phase1geo
 Fixing some problems with new FSM code.  Not quite there yet.

 Revision 1.22  2003/08/25 13:02:03  phase1geo
 Initial stab at adding FSM support.  Contains summary reporting capability
 at this point and roughly works.  Updated regress suite as a result of these
 changes.

 Revision 1.21  2003/08/05 20:25:05  phase1geo
 Fixing non-blocking bug and updating regression files according to the fix.
 Also added function vector_is_unknown() which can be called before making
 a call to vector_to_int() which will eleviate any X/Z-values causing problems
 with this conversion.  Additionally, the real1.1 regression report files were
 updated.

 Revision 1.20  2003/02/08 21:54:06  phase1geo
 Fixing memory problems with db_remove_statement function.  Updating comments
 in statement.c to explain some of the changes necessary to properly remove
 a statement tree.

 Revision 1.19  2003/02/07 02:28:23  phase1geo
 Fixing bug with statement removal.  Expressions were being deallocated but not properly
 removed from module parameter expression lists and module expression lists.  Regression
 now passes again.

 Revision 1.18  2003/02/05 22:50:56  phase1geo
 Some minor tweaks to debug output and some minor bug "fixes".  At this point
 regression isn't stable yet.

 Revision 1.17  2003/01/04 09:33:28  phase1geo
 Updating documentation to match recent code fixes/changes.

 Revision 1.16  2003/01/04 09:25:15  phase1geo
 Fixing file search algorithm to fix bug where unexpected module that was
 ignored cannot be found.  Added instance7.v diagnostic to verify appropriate
 handling of this problem.  Added tree.c and tree.h and removed define_t
 structure in lexer.

 Revision 1.15  2003/01/03 02:07:43  phase1geo
 Fixing segmentation fault in lexer caused by not closing the temporary
 input file before unlinking it.  Fixed case where module was parsed but not
 at the head of the module list.

 Revision 1.14  2002/12/06 02:18:59  phase1geo
 Fixing bug with calculating list and concatenation lengths when MBIT_SEL
 expressions were included.  Also modified file parsing algorithm to be
 smarter when searching files for modules.  This change makes the parsing
 algorithm much more optimized and fixes the bug specified in our bug list.
 Added diagnostic to verify fix for first bug.

 Revision 1.13  2002/11/02 16:16:20  phase1geo
 Cleaned up all compiler warnings in source and header files.

 Revision 1.12  2002/10/29 19:57:50  phase1geo
 Fixing problems with beginning block comments within comments which are
 produced automatically by CVS.  Should fix warning messages from compiler.

 Revision 1.11  2002/10/29 13:33:21  phase1geo
 Adding patches for 64-bit compatibility.  Reformatted parser.y for easier
 viewing (removed tabs).  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.10  2002/10/25 13:43:49  phase1geo
 Adding statement iterators for moving in both directions in a list with a single
 pointer (two-way).  This allows us to reverse statement lists without additional
 memory and time (very efficient).  Full regression passes and TODO list items
 2 and 3 are completed.

 Revision 1.9  2002/07/23 12:56:22  phase1geo
 Fixing some memory overflow issues.  Still getting core dumps in some areas.

 Revision 1.8  2002/07/18 22:02:35  phase1geo
 In the middle of making improvements/fixes to the expression/signal
 binding phase.

 Revision 1.7  2002/06/26 22:09:17  phase1geo
 Removing unecessary output and updating regression Makefile.

 Revision 1.6  2002/06/26 03:45:48  phase1geo
 Fixing more bugs in simulator and report functions.  About to add support
 for delay statements.

 Revision 1.5  2002/06/25 03:39:03  phase1geo
 Fixed initial scoring bugs.  We now generate a legal CDD file for reporting.
 Fixed some report bugs though there are still some remaining.

 Revision 1.4  2002/06/25 02:02:04  phase1geo
 Fixing bugs with writing/reading statements and with parsing design with
 statements.  We now get to the scoring section.  Some problems here at
 the moment with the simulator.

 Revision 1.3  2002/05/03 03:39:36  phase1geo
 Removing all syntax errors due to addition of statements.  Added more statement
 support code.  Still have a ways to go before we can try anything.  Removed lines
 from expressions though we may want to consider putting these back for reporting
 purposes.
