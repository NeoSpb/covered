 \par
 To accommodate the need for parameters/genvars (variables) in static expressions, the static_expr
 structure and supporting code was created to maintain the efficiency of static expressions
 that consist of known values while being able to keep track of parameter/genvar uses in
 static expressions.
 
 \par
 A static_expr structure consists of members:  an int (stores known integer values) and an
 expression pointer.  If the expression pointer is set to NULL for the given static_expr,
 it is assumed that the static_expr structure contains a valid, known value that can be
 used in immediate computations.  If the expression pointer is not NULL, it is assumed
 that the static_expr structure contains an expression tree that needs to be evaluated at
 a later time (when parameters/genvars are being elaborated).
 
 \par
 When a static expression is being parsed and a static value (integer value) is encountered,
 a new static_expr is allocated from heap memory and the number field is assigned to this
 integer value.  The new static_expr structure is then passed up the tree to be used in
 further calculations, if necessary.  If a static expression is being parsed and an identifier
 (parameter/genvar) is encountered, an expression is created with an operation type of EXP_OP_SIG
 to indicate that a parameter/genvar is required during elaboration.  The name of the necessary
 parameter/genvar is bound to the newly created expression.
 
 \par
 Using this strategy for handling static expressions, it becomes evident that we retain
 the efficiency of calculating static expression that consists entirely of known values (the
 only overhead is the allocation/deallocation of a static_expr structure from the heap).
 If a parameter/genvar is found during the parse stage, more effort is required to calculate the
 static_expr, but this is considered necessary in the larger scope of things so we will not
 concern ourselves with this overhead (which is fairly minimal anyways).

 Revision 1.35.2.2  2008/05/28 05:57:12  phase1geo
 Updating code to use unsigned long instead of uint32.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.35.2.1  2008/04/23 05:20:45  phase1geo
 Completed initial pass of code updates.  I can now begin testing...  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.35  2008/04/08 19:50:36  phase1geo
 Removing LAST operator for PEDGE, NEDGE and AEDGE expression operations and
 replacing them with the temporary vector solution.

 Revision 1.34  2008/04/06 21:31:14  phase1geo
 Fixing more regression failures.  Last of regression updates.

 Revision 1.33  2008/03/17 05:26:17  phase1geo
 Checkpointing.  Things don't compile at the moment.

 Revision 1.32  2008/03/11 22:06:49  phase1geo
 Finishing first round of exception handling code.

 Revision 1.31  2008/03/04 06:46:48  phase1geo

 Switched totals over from float types to int types for splint purposes.

 Revision 1.28  2007/12/11 05:48:26  phase1geo
 Fixing more compile errors with new code changes and adding more profiling.
 Still have a ways to go before we can compile cleanly again (next submission

 Revision 1.19  2006/04/21 06:14:45  phase1geo
 Merged in changes from 0.4.3 stable release.  Updated all regression files
 for inclusion of OVL library.  More documentation updates for next development
 release (but there is more to go here).

 Revision 1.18  2006/04/13 14:59:25  phase1geo
 Updating CDD version from 6 to 7 due to changes in the merge facility.  Full
 regression now passes.

 Revision 1.17.4.1.4.1  2006/05/27 05:56:14  phase1geo
 Fixing last problem with bug fix.  Updated date on NEWS.

 Revision 1.17.4.1  2006/04/20 21:55:16  phase1geo
 Adding support for big endian signals.  Added new endian1 diagnostic to regression
 suite to verify this new functionality.  Full regression passes.  We may want to do
 some more testing on variants of this before calling it ready for stable release 0.4.3.

 Revision 1.17  2006/03/28 22:28:28  phase1geo
 Updates to user guide and added copyright information to each source file in the
 src directory.  Added test directory in user documentation directory containing the
 example used in line, toggle, combinational logic and FSM descriptions.

 Revision 1.16  2006/02/16 21:19:26  phase1geo
 Adding support for arrays of instances.  Also fixing some memory problems for
 constant functions and fixed binding problems when hierarchical references are
 made to merged modules.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.15  2006/01/19 00:01:09  phase1geo
 Lots of changes/additions.  Summary report window work is now complete (with the
 exception of adding extra features).  Added support for parsing left and right
 shift operators and the exponent operator in static expression scenarios.  Fixed
 issues related to GUI (due to recent changes in the score command).  Things seem
 to be generally working as expected with the GUI now.

 Revision 1.14  2006/01/13 04:01:04  phase1geo
 Adding support for exponential operation.  Added exponent1 diagnostic to verify
 but Icarus does not support this currently.

 Revision 1.13  2005/01/07 17:59:52  phase1geo
 Finalized updates for supplemental field changes.  Everything compiles and links
 correctly at this time; however, a regression run has not confirmed the changes.

 Revision 1.12  2004/04/19 04:54:56  phase1geo
 Adding first and last column information to expression and related code.  This is
 not working correctly yet.

 Revision 1.11  2004/03/16 05:45:43  phase1geo
 Checkin contains a plethora of changes, bug fixes, enhancements...
 Some of which include:  new diagnostics to verify bug fixes found in field,
 test generator script for creating new diagnostics, enhancing error reporting
 output to include filename and line number of failing code (useful for error
 regression testing), support for error regression testing, bug fixes for
 segmentation fault errors found in field, additional data integrity features,
 and code support for GUI tool (this submission does not include TCL files).

 Revision 1.10  2003/11/26 23:14:41  phase1geo
 Adding code to include left-hand-side expressions of statements for report
 outputting purposes.  Full regression does not yet pass.

 Revision 1.9  2003/10/17 12:55:36  phase1geo
 Intermediate checkin for LSB fixes.

 Revision 1.8  2003/10/11 05:15:08  phase1geo
 Updates for code optimizations for vector value data type (integers to chars).
 Updated regression for changes.

 Revision 1.7  2002/11/02 16:16:20  phase1geo
 Cleaned up all compiler warnings in source and header files.

 Revision 1.6  2002/10/31 23:14:28  phase1geo
 Fixing C compatibility problems with cc and gcc.  Found a few possible problems
 with 64-bit vs. 32-bit compilation of the tool.  Fixed bug in parser that
 lead to bus errors.  Ran full regression in 64-bit mode without error.

 Revision 1.5  2002/10/29 19:57:51  phase1geo
 Fixing problems with beginning block comments within comments which are
 produced automatically by CVS.  Should fix warning messages from compiler.

 Revision 1.4  2002/10/23 03:39:07  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in MBIT_SEL expressions to calculate the expression widths
 correctly.  Updated diagnostic testsuite and added diagnostic that
 found the original bug.  A few documentation updates.

 Revision 1.3  2002/10/12 06:51:34  phase1geo
 Updating development documentation to match all changes within source.
 Adding new development pages created by Doxygen for the new source
 files.

 Revision 1.2  2002/10/11 04:24:02  phase1geo
 This checkin represents some major code renovation in the score command to
 fully accommodate parameter support.  All parameter support is in at this
 point and the most commonly used parameter usages have been verified.  Some
 bugs were fixed in handling default values of constants and expression tree
 resizing has been optimized to its fullest.  Full regression has been
 updated and passes.  Adding new diagnostics to test suite.  Fixed a few
 problems in report outputting.

 Revision 1.1  2002/10/02 18:55:29  phase1geo
 Adding static.c and static.h files for handling static expressions found by
 the parser.  Initial versions which compile but have not been tested.
