 $Log$
 Revision 1.28.4.1  2008/07/10 22:43:56  phase1geo
 Merging in rank-devel-branch into this branch.  Added -f options for all commands
 to allow files containing command-line arguments to be added.  A few error diagnostics
 are currently failing due to changes in the rank branch that never got fixed in that
 branch.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.29  2008/06/27 14:02:05  phase1geo
 Fixing splint and -Wextra warnings.  Also fixing comment formatting.

 Revision 1.28  2008/04/15 06:08:47  phase1geo
 First attempt to get both instance and module coverage calculatable for
 GUI purposes.  This is not quite complete at the moment though it does
 compile.

 Revision 1.27  2008/03/13 10:28:55  phase1geo
 The last of the exception handling modifications.

 Revision 1.26  2008/02/09 19:32:45  phase1geo
 Completed first round of modifications for using exception handler.  Regression
 passes with these changes.  Updated regressions per these changes.

 Revision 1.25  2008/02/08 23:58:07  phase1geo
 Starting to work on exception handling.  Much work to do here (things don't
 compile at the moment).

 Revision 1.24  2008/02/01 06:37:09  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in genprof.pl.  Added initial code for excluding final blocks and
 using pragma excludes (this code is not fully working yet).  More to be done.

 Revision 1.23  2008/01/10 04:59:05  phase1geo
 More splint updates.  All exportlocal cases are now taken care of.

 Revision 1.22  2008/01/09 05:22:22  phase1geo
 More splint updates using the -standard option.

 Revision 1.21  2007/12/18 23:55:21  phase1geo
 Starting to remove 64-bit time and replacing it with a sim_time structure
 for performance enhancement purposes.  Also removing global variables for time-related
 information and passing this information around by reference for performance
 enhancement purposes.

 Revision 1.20  2007/11/20 05:29:00  phase1geo
 Updating e-mail address from trevorw@charter.net to phase1geo@gmail.com.

 Revision 1.19  2007/03/30 22:43:13  phase1geo
 Regression fixes.  Still have a ways to go but we are getting close.

 Revision 1.18  2006/11/27 04:11:42  phase1geo
 Adding more changes to properly support thread time.  This is a work in progress
 and regression is currently broken for the moment.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.17  2006/09/20 22:38:10  phase1geo
 Lots of changes to support memories and multi-dimensional arrays.  We still have
 issues with endianness and VCS regressions have not been run, but this is a significant
 amount of work that needs to be checkpointed.

 Revision 1.16  2006/09/15 22:14:54  phase1geo
 Working on adding arrayed signals.  This is currently in progress and doesn't
 even compile at this point, much less work.  Checkpointing work.

 Revision 1.15  2006/07/25 21:35:54  phase1geo
 Fixing nested namespace problem with generate blocks.  Also adding support
 for using generate values in expressions.  Still not quite working correctly
 yet, but the format of the CDD file looks good as far as I can tell at this
 point.

 Revision 1.14  2006/05/28 02:43:49  phase1geo
 Integrating stable release 0.4.4 changes into main branch.  Updated regressions
 appropriately.

 Revision 1.13  2006/05/25 12:11:03  phase1geo
 Including bug fix from 0.4.4 stable release and updating regressions.

 Revision 1.12  2006/04/21 06:14:45  phase1geo
 Merged in changes from 0.4.3 stable release.  Updated all regression files
 for inclusion of OVL library.  More documentation updates for next development
 release (but there is more to go here).

 Revision 1.11.4.1  2006/04/20 21:55:16  phase1geo
 Adding support for big endian signals.  Added new endian1 diagnostic to regression
 suite to verify this new functionality.  Full regression passes.  We may want to do
 some more testing on variants of this before calling it ready for stable release 0.4.3.

 Revision 1.11  2006/03/28 22:28:28  phase1geo
 Updates to user guide and added copyright information to each source file in the
 src directory.  Added test directory in user documentation directory containing the
 example used in line, toggle, combinational logic and FSM descriptions.

 Revision 1.10  2006/01/23 03:53:30  phase1geo
 Adding support for input/output ports of tasks/functions.  Regressions are not
 running cleanly at this point so there is still some work to do here.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.9  2006/01/19 23:10:38  phase1geo
 Adding line and starting column information to vsignal structure (and associated CDD
 files).  Regression has been fully updated for this change which now fully passes.  Final
 changes to summary GUI.  Fixed signal underlining for toggle coverage to work for both
 explicit and implicit signals.  Getting things ready for a preferences window.

 Revision 1.8  2006/01/05 05:52:06  phase1geo
 Removing wait bit in vector supplemental field and modifying algorithm to only
 assign in the post-sim location (pre-sim now is gone).  This fixes some issues
 with simulation results and increases performance a bit.  Updated regressions
 for these changes.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.7  2005/12/01 16:08:19  phase1geo
 Allowing nested functional units within a module to get parsed and handled correctly.
 Added new nested_block1 diagnostic to test nested named blocks -- will add more tests
 later for different combinations.  Updated regression suite which now passes.

 Revision 1.6  2005/11/10 19:28:23  phase1geo
 Updates/fixes for tasks/functions.  Also updated Tcl/Tk scripts for these changes.
 Fixed bug with net_decl_assign statements -- the line, start column and end column
 information was incorrect, causing problems with the GUI output.

 Revision 1.5  2005/11/08 23:12:10  phase1geo
 Fixes for function/task additions.  Still a lot of testing on these structures;
 however, regressions now pass again so we are checkpointing here.

 Revision 1.4  2005/02/16 13:45:04  phase1geo
 Adding value propagation function to vsignal.c and adding this propagation to
 BASSIGN expression assignment after the assignment occurs.

 Revision 1.3  2005/01/10 02:59:30  phase1geo
 Code added for race condition checking that checks for signals being assigned
 in multiple statements.  Working on handling bit selects -- this is in progress.

 Revision 1.2  2004/04/05 12:30:52  phase1geo
 Adding *db_replace functions to allow a design to be opened with new CDD
 results (for GUI purposes only).

 Revision 1.1  2004/03/30 15:42:15  phase1geo
 Renaming signal type to vsignal type to eliminate compilation problems on systems
 that contain a signal type in the OS.

 Revision 1.16  2004/01/08 23:24:41  phase1geo
 Removing unnecessary scope information from signals, expressions and
 statements to reduce file sizes of CDDs and slightly speeds up fscanf
 function calls.  Updated regression for this fix.

 Revision 1.15  2003/10/17 12:55:36  phase1geo
 Intermediate checkin for LSB fixes.

 Revision 1.14  2003/10/10 20:52:07  phase1geo
 Initial submission of FSM expression allowance code.  We are still not quite
 there yet, but we are getting close.

 Revision 1.13  2003/10/02 12:30:56  phase1geo
 Initial code modifications to handle more robust FSM cases.

 Revision 1.12  2003/08/15 03:52:22  phase1geo
 More checkins of last checkin and adding some missing files.

 Revision 1.11  2003/02/13 23:44:08  phase1geo
 Tentative fix for VCD file reading.  Not sure if it works correctly when
 original signal LSB is != 0.  Icarus Verilog testsuite passes.

 Revision 1.10  2002/12/30 05:31:33  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in module merge for reports when parameterized modules are merged.
 These modules should not output an error to the user when mismatching modules
 are found.

 Revision 1.9  2002/11/05 00:20:08  phase1geo
 Adding development documentation.  Fixing problem with combinational logic
 output in report command and updating full regression.

 Revision 1.8  2002/11/02 16:16:20  phase1geo
 Cleaned up all compiler warnings in source and header files.

 Revision 1.7  2002/10/31 23:14:24  phase1geo
 Fixing C compatibility problems with cc and gcc.  Found a few possible problems
 with 64-bit vs. 32-bit compilation of the tool.  Fixed bug in parser that
 lead to bus errors.  Ran full regression in 64-bit mode without error.

 Revision 1.6  2002/10/29 19:57:51  phase1geo
 Fixing problems with beginning block comments within comments which are
 produced automatically by CVS.  Should fix warning messages from compiler.

 Revision 1.5  2002/09/25 02:51:44  phase1geo
 Removing need of vector nibble array allocation and deallocation during
 expression resizing for efficiency and bug reduction.  Other enhancements
 for parameter support.  Parameter stuff still not quite complete.

 Revision 1.4  2002/08/19 04:34:07  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in database reading code that dealt with merging modules.  Module
 merging is now performed in a more optimal way.  Full regression passes and
 own examples pass as well.

 Revision 1.3  2002/07/17 06:27:18  phase1geo
 Added start for fixes to bit select code starting with single bit selection.
 Full regression passes with addition of sbit_sel1 diagnostic.
