 Revision 1.44.4.2  2008/07/23 21:38:42  phase1geo
 Adding better formatting for ranking reports to allow the inclusion of the full
 pathname for each CDD file listed.

 Revision 1.44.4.1  2008/07/10 22:43:54  phase1geo
 Merging in rank-devel-branch into this branch.  Added -f options for all commands
 to allow files containing command-line arguments to be added.  A few error diagnostics
 are currently failing due to changes in the rank branch that never got fixed in that
 branch.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.45  2008/06/27 14:02:04  phase1geo
 Fixing splint and -Wextra warnings.  Also fixing comment formatting.

 Revision 1.44  2008/04/15 20:37:11  phase1geo
 Fixing database array support.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.43  2008/03/17 22:02:32  phase1geo
 Adding new check_mem script and adding output to perform memory checking during
 regression runs.  Completed work on free_safe and added realloc_safe function
 calls.  Regressions are pretty broke at the moment.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.42  2008/03/14 22:00:20  phase1geo
 Beginning to instrument code for exception handling verification.  Still have
 a ways to go before we have anything that is self-checking at this point, though.

 Revision 1.41  2008/03/11 22:06:49  phase1geo
 Finishing first round of exception handling code.

 Revision 1.40  2008/02/22 20:39:22  phase1geo
 More updates for exception handling.

 Revision 1.39  2008/02/09 19:32:45  phase1geo
 Completed first round of modifications for using exception handler.  Regression
 passes with these changes.  Updated regressions per these changes.

 Revision 1.38  2008/01/21 21:39:55  phase1geo
 Bug fix for bug 1876376.

 Revision 1.37  2008/01/16 23:10:33  phase1geo
 More splint updates.  Code is now warning/error free with current version
 of run_splint.  Still have regression issues to debug.

 Revision 1.36  2008/01/09 05:22:22  phase1geo
 More splint updates using the -standard option.

 Revision 1.35  2008/01/08 21:13:08  phase1geo
 Completed -weak splint run.  Full regressions pass.

 Revision 1.34  2008/01/07 23:59:55  phase1geo
 More splint updates.

 Revision 1.33  2007/12/11 05:48:26  phase1geo
 Fixing more compile errors with new code changes and adding more profiling.
 Still have a ways to go before we can compile cleanly again (next submission
 should do it).

 Revision 1.32  2007/11/20 05:29:00  phase1geo
 Updating e-mail address from trevorw@charter.net to phase1geo@gmail.com.

 Revision 1.31  2007/03/30 22:43:13  phase1geo
 Regression fixes.  Still have a ways to go but we are getting close.

 Revision 1.30  2007/03/13 22:12:59  phase1geo
 Merging changes to covered-0_5-branch to fix bug 1678931.

 Revision 1.29.2.1  2007/03/13 22:05:11  phase1geo
 Fixing bug 1678931.  Updated regression.

 Revision 1.29  2006/11/25 21:29:01  phase1geo
 Adding timescale diagnostics to regression suite and fixing bugs in core associated
 with this code.  Full regression now passes for IV and Cver (not in VPI mode).

 Revision 1.28  2006/09/01 04:06:37  phase1geo
 Added code to support more than one instance tree.  Currently, I am seeing
 quite a few memory errors that are causing some major problems at the moment.
 Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.27  2006/08/31 22:32:18  phase1geo
 Things are in a state of flux at the moment.  I have added proper parsing support
 for assertions, properties and sequences.  Also added partial support for the $root
 space (though I need to work on figuring out how to handle it in terms of the
 instance tree) and all that goes along with that.  Add parsing support with an
 error message for multi-dimensional array declarations.  Regressions should not be
 expected to run correctly at the moment.

 Revision 1.26  2006/07/12 22:16:18  phase1geo
 Fixing hierarchical referencing for instance arrays.  Also attempted to fix
 a problem found with unary1; however, the generated report coverage information
 does not look correct at this time.  Checkpointing what I have done for now.

 Revision 1.25  2006/04/18 21:59:54  phase1geo
 Adding support for environment variable substitution in configuration files passed
 to the score command.  Adding ovl.c/ovl.h files.  Working on support for assertion
 coverage in report command.  Still have a bit to go here yet.

 Revision 1.24  2006/04/11 22:42:16  phase1geo
 First pass at adding multi-file merging.  Still need quite a bit of work here yet.

 Revision 1.23  2006/03/28 22:28:28  phase1geo
 Updates to user guide and added copyright information to each source file in the
 src directory.  Added test directory in user documentation directory containing the
 example used in line, toggle, combinational logic and FSM descriptions.

 Revision 1.22  2006/02/16 21:19:26  phase1geo
 Adding support for arrays of instances.  Also fixing some memory problems for
 constant functions and fixed binding problems when hierarchical references are
 made to merged modules.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.21  2006/01/14 04:17:23  phase1geo
 Adding is_func_unit function to check to see if a -e value is a valid module, function,
 task or named begin/end block.  Updated regression accordingly.  We are getting closer
 but still have a few diagnostics to figure out yet.

 Revision 1.20  2005/12/12 23:25:37  phase1geo
 Fixing memory faults.  This is a work in progress.

 Revision 1.19  2005/11/08 23:12:10  phase1geo
 Fixes for function/task additions.  Still a lot of testing on these structures;
 however, regressions now pass again so we are checkpointing here.

 Revision 1.18  2005/01/03 23:00:35  phase1geo
 Fixing library extension parser.

 Revision 1.17  2005/01/03 22:02:27  phase1geo
 Fixing case where file is specified with -v after it has already been included to
 just ignore the file instead of printing out an incorrect error message that the
 file was unable to be opened.

 Revision 1.16  2004/03/16 05:45:43  phase1geo
 Checkin contains a plethora of changes, bug fixes, enhancements...
 Some of which include:  new diagnostics to verify bug fixes found in field,
 test generator script for creating new diagnostics, enhancing error reporting
 output to include filename and line number of failing code (useful for error
 regression testing), support for error regression testing, bug fixes for
 segmentation fault errors found in field, additional data integrity features,
 and code support for GUI tool (this submission does not include TCL files).

 Revision 1.15  2004/03/15 21:38:17  phase1geo
 Updated source files after running lint on these files.  Full regression
 still passes at this point.

 Revision 1.14  2003/02/17 22:47:20  phase1geo
 Fixing bug with merging same DUTs from different testbenches.  Updated reports
 to display full path instead of instance name and parent instance name.  Added
 merge tests and added merge testing into regression test suite.  Fixing bug with
 -D/-Q option specified with merge command.  Full regression passing.

 Revision 1.13  2002/11/02 16:16:20  phase1geo
 Cleaned up all compiler warnings in source and header files.

 Revision 1.12  2002/10/29 19:57:51  phase1geo
 Fixing problems with beginning block comments within comments which are
 produced automatically by CVS.  Should fix warning messages from compiler.

 Revision 1.11  2002/10/13 13:55:53  phase1geo
 Fixing instance depth selection and updating all configuration files for
 regression.  Full regression now passes.

 Revision 1.10  2002/10/11 05:23:21  phase1geo
 Removing local user message allocation and replacing with global to help
 with memory efficiency.

 Revision 1.9  2002/08/19 21:36:26  phase1geo
 Fixing memory corruption bug in score function for adding Verilog modules
 to use_files list.  This caused a core dump to occur when the -f option
 was used.

 Revision 1.8  2002/07/20 20:48:09  phase1geo
 Fixing a bug that caused the same file to be added to the use_files list
 more than once.  A filename will only appear once in this list now.  Updates
 to the TODO list.

 Revision 1.7  2002/07/18 05:50:45  phase1geo
 Fixes should be just about complete for instance depth problems now.  Diagnostics
 to help verify instance handling are added to regression.  Full regression passes.

 Revision 1.6  2002/07/18 02:33:24  phase1geo
 Fixed instantiation addition.  Multiple hierarchy instantiation trees should
 now work.

 Revision 1.5  2002/07/11 19:12:38  phase1geo
 Fixing version number.  Fixing bug with score command if -t option was not
 specified to avoid a segmentation fault.

 Revision 1.4  2002/07/08 19:02:12  phase1geo
 Adding -i option to properly handle modules specified for coverage that
 are instantiated within a design without needing to parse parent modules.

 Revision 1.3  2002/07/08 12:35:31  phase1geo
 Added initial support for library searching.  Code seems to be broken at the
 moment.

 Revision 1.2  2002/07/03 03:31:11  phase1geo
 Adding RCS Log strings in files that were missing them so that file version
 information is contained in every source and header file.  Reordering src
 Makefile to be alphabetical.  Adding mult1.v diagnostic to regression suite.
