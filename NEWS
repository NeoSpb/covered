Covered-Related NEWS
====================

    * 3/29/2006

Stable release covered-0.4 made.  In addition to all of the features, optimizations and bug fixes
that have gone into the development releases from the 0.3 stable release, the following features, updates
and bug fixes have been added.

  - Fixed bug with a statement connection issue that causes lines of code to be not considered for
    coverage that should have been.
  - Fixed bug in report command where combinational expressions were not being output to match the original
    Verilog code.
  - Added CDD file viewer window to GUI to allow the user to see which CDD files are currently loaded/merged.
  - Fixed bug in combinational logic verbose viewer which caused the window to resize dependent upon
    the location of the cursor (this was an annoyance)
  - Changed the output of simple combinational logic to change to unary combinational logic output if either
    the left or the right expression was a constant value (eliminates unachievable combinational logic cases
    from being output leading to more accurate coverage results).
  - Removed combinational expressions that contain only constant values from being considered for coverage.
  - Updated simple combinational logic output in reports to be as concise as possible for AND and OR type
    expressions.
  - Removed duplication of information in CDD files for race conditions.
  - Fixed bug in GUI dealing with showing race conditions
  - Fixing bug in GUI pertaining to the next/previous buttons in the combinational logic detail viewer.  Previously,
    clicking on one of these buttons would only advance you to the next uncovered line.  Now it will advance
    you to the next uncovered statement.
  - Updated development, user and GUI documentation to reflect the above changes and to bring them up-to-date
    with the rest of the tool.

Please see the ChangeLog file for all changes made from the 0.3 stable release to the 0.4 stable release.
Lots of enhancements, features, optimizations, bug fixes, performance improvements and documentation improvements
are contained in this stable release, making it very worth while for any Covered users to get their hands on
it.

    * 2/18/2006

Development release covered-20060218 made.  A lot of work has gone into adding a lot more Verilog-2001
support, added Verilog-1995 support, GUI improvements/fixes, user documentation additions/updates,
adding LXT dumpfile support and the usual bug fixes.  I have also removed the diagnostic directory from
the Covered tarball and am making it available as its own tarball since it is growing by leaps and bounds
these days.   The following is a list of the changes in this release from the past release.

  - Added support for the following Verilog 2001 constructs:
    - `ifndef, `elsif and `line preprocessor directives
    - Constant function support
    - Explicitly named parameter overrides
    - Correct support for localparam
    - Implicit (wildcard) sensitivity lists (@*)
    - Support for signed values (integers are now treated as signed values) and proper handling of
      signed expressions
    - Immediate register assignment (ex. reg a = 1'b0)
    - Variable multi-bit selects (ex. a[b+:10] or a[b-:2])
    - Exponential power operator (**)
    - Arithmetic shift operators (>>> and <<<)
    - Inline parameters (i.e., parameters placed before a module port list)
    - Inline port declarations (ex.  module foo ( input wire [1:0] a, ... );)
    - "Null" parameter overrides (ex.  foo #(0,,2) bar (...);)
    - Arrays of instances
    - Added more support for attribute locations
  - Added support for using LXT/LXT2 -style dumpfiles instead of just VCD files
  - Fixing bug to properly bind to the appropriate task, function or named block when there
    are two or more of this functional units with the same name.
  - Changed all error information to get sent to stderr regardless of the output mode we are in
  - Added left shift, right shift, exponential power, and constant function call operators to list
    of valid operators to be used in constant expressions.
  - Fixed bug for resolving parameter values that are used in tasks, functions or named blocks but
    are not declared there (they are declared in the parent module).
  - Added full support for hierarchical referencing
  - Added full support for escaped names (ex. wire \some_name[0] ;)
  - Added support for performing bit selection on RHS of parameter assignments
  - Added full support for sizing parameters (ex. "parameter [2:0] foo = 0;")
  - Fixed ASCII report output to display uncovered toggle signals in line order (this was inverted
    for some reason).
  - Fixed bug in score command-line parser to not segfault if file given in -f option is empty
  - Fixed several bugs in GUI
  - Added additional features for report GUI
    - Added summary report window with ability to see modules/instances ordered by coverage
      percentage for a given metric in either increasing or decreasing order (coverage information
      is also color-coded to make it easy to tell which modules are "fully covered", "covered well
      enough", or "not covered well enough").
    - Added preferences window and removed preferences menu -- improved method of color selection
      and added a coverage "good enough" selector used in the summary window
    - Changed toggle coverage source code browser to only underline one instance of an uncovered
      signal (this position is first implicit or explicit declaration of the signal) to improve
      readability.
    - Added configuration file read/write support for storage of Covered's preferences
    - Added help buttons to toggle detail, combinational logic detail, preferences and summary window
      to allow online help pages to be displayed for the current window
    - Added GUI online help pages for toggle window, combinational logic window, preferences window
      and summary window as well as updated all out-of-date information.
    - Added navigational GUI elements to help the user find the next/previous uncovered line from any
      window.  Also added a search GUI element for finding any string in the source code window.
  - Updates to user guide and development documentaiton to bring things up-to-date.

  In summary, there have been lots of features added to both the score command and GUI report tool.
  The CDD files generated from this release are not backward compatible with older releases.  I plan
  to make this version the next stable release once it has had some more test time applied to it.
  So please submit those bugs!

    * 1/9/2006

Development release covered-20060109 made.  It has been almost a year since the last development
release of Covered, but in the meantime there has been a lot of work put into the score command
of Covered during this time to fix bugs, add more coverage support for various Verilog constructs,
simulate more accurately, remove memory corruption/estrangement and improve the run-time speed
of the score command.  I think that user's of Covered will appreciate the enhancements.  Documentation
updates have been made and build problems have been fixed (Covered now compiles cleanly for
Fedora Core 3 builds).  I plan to revisit Covered's GUI in the next release to fix various bugs
and improve the usability.  The following is a description of what has changed in this release from the
last release:

  - Blocking assignments in covered blocks are now performed by Covered's simulation core instead of
    being taken from the dumpfile to improve simulation/coverage accuracy.
  - Fixed lots bugs with statement block removal
  - Added patch to parser.y to fix compiling problems with bison-2.0.
  - Increased space for module/instance name in reports
  - Added full support for the following Verilog constructs:
    - tasks and task calls
    - functions and function calls
    - named begin/end blocks
    - fork/join
    - event types and event triggers
    - hierarchical referencing (both relative and top-of-tree scoping)
    - initial blocks
    - for, repeat and while looping
    - block disabling
  - Fixed bug with net_decl_assign statements (the line, start column and end column information was
    incorrect, causing problems with the GUI output).
  - Fixed implicit signal creation in binding functions.
  - Fixed binding with merge command. 
  - Added --enable-debug configuration option to remove verbose outputting code from compilation.
    This significantly improves run-time performance.
  - Better race condition reporting
  - Lots of fixes related to bad memory accesses and memory leaks (found using the valgrind utility).
  - Removed Tcl/Tk from source files if HAVE_TCLTK is not defined.
  - Added ability to exclude functions, tasks and named begin/end blocks with the -e score command
  - Added ability to exclude all continuous assignments from coverage consideration with -ec score command
  - Added ability to exclude all always blocks from coverage consideration with -ea score command
  - Added ability to exclude all initial blocks from coverage consideration with -ei score command
  - Fixed problem with race condition checker statement iterator to eliminate infinite looping.
  - Also fixed expression assigment when static expressions are used in the LHS
  - Fixed bug for signals that are on the LHS side of an assignment expression but are not being
    assigned (bit selects) so that these are NOT considered for race conditions.
  - Added simulation performance statistical information to end of score command when the -S option is
    specified to the score command (this will probably only be useful for Covered developers but may
    be interesting/useful for users later on).
  - Fixing bug in expression_assign function -- removed recursive assignment when the LHS expression
    is a signal, single-bit, multi-bit or static value (only recurse when the LHS is a CONCAT or
    LIST).
  - Fixing bug in report help information when Tcl/Tk is not available
  - Lots of improvements to simulator to increase performance (this will be quite noticeable!)
  - Documentation updates
  - Regression suite enhancements (lots of new diagnostics added for testing new Verilog constructs as well
    as testing bug fixes).
  - Added cleanup function at exit which now automatically removes the temporary files that Covered creates
    from the pre-processing step even when something goes drastically wrong while this file is opened.

Note:  The format of the generated CDD files has changed quite a bit in format so you will not be able
to merge CDD files generated from older versions of Covered with CDD files generated from newer versions
of Covered (Covered will display an error message to the user stating this reason).  As always, please
e-mail any bugs/problems found with this new release!

    * 2/8/2005

Development release covered-20050208 made.  This release primarily contains support for detecting
and handling race conditions with the DUT.  Added flags to the score command control the behavior
of Covered when these race conditions are detected.  Additionally, the race condition information
is saved to the CDD file for reporting purposes in both the text reports as well as the GUI.  This
feature is not only useful to logic designers but also sets up Covered to provide better coverage
results going forward as well as allows Covered to gain coverage for some constructs that are
currently not supported.  A few other bugs are fixed in this release as well as documentation
updates for the race condition usage.  The following is a description of what has changed in this
release:

  - Added support for detecting/handling race conditions in DUT
  - Added ability to report race conditions to report command
  - Fixing bug in file search algorithm.  When a file was specified with a -v option after it
    had already been included, an error was being reported and parsing stopped.  In this case, it
    now just ignores the duplicate include.
  - Fixed preprocessor to ignore protected areas of code.
  - Fixed library extension command-line parser.
  - Changed was data is stored on a bit-basis for certain data types to use unions.  Eases coding
    and improves performance of score command just a bit.
  - Added support for Verilog strings as static values.  Strings can also be used in FSM value assignment
    from command-line or from inline attribute.
  - Ran -Wall compiler flag to clean up code.
  - Added race condition run to regression
  - Updated man page, User Guide and GUI documentation for changes
  - Fixing bug in GUI where deselecting/selecting Covered, Uncovered or Race Condition in combinational
    logic window would redisplay the file incorrectly.
  - Added code to display help information in information bar of GUI main window when cursor is
    over missed toggle and/or combinational logic coverage
  - Added code to display reason for race condition when cursor is over lines that were discarded from
    coverage consideration.

    * 12/10/2004

Development release covered-20041210 made.  This release contains summary and detailed coverage
reporting windows for toggle and combinational logic to the GUI.  Lots of bug fixes, updates
and enhancements to the UI.  The scoring phase was optimized a bit to improve run-time.
Additionally, help manual has been started for the current state of the GUI.  The following
is a description of the changes found in this release over the last.

  - Fixing case where user hits cancel button in the open CDD window and application exits.
  - Added module/instance highlighting in listbox for uncovered modules/instances.
  - Adding informational bar at the bottom of the main window for providing state-sensitive
    help/state information.
  - Added ability to make module/instance listbox resizable.
  - Fixed configure files for Tcl/TK referencing.
  - Fixed bug in getting the line summary total for the GUI.
  - Fixed problem where source viewer would lose its place when switching between different
    coverage metrics, changing colors and/or specifying different uncovered/covered options.
  - Added 'Open Related CDD' and 'Merge related CDD' options to File menu to allow user to see
    different CDD files generated from the same design and to merge CDD information from the
    same design.
  - Added verbose toggle coverage information window, allowing the user to see verbose information
    for a signal by left-clicking on the signal in the source viewer.
  - Added verbose combinational coverage information window, allowing the user to see verbose
    information for an expression by left-clicking on the expression in the source viewer.
  - Modified error reporting for GUI to display this information to an interactive window (instead
    of the the shell).
  - Added code to improve efficiency during scoring phase.  The improvement is fairly minor at this
    stage, but there is more to come with these changes.
  - Added start of help manual documentation for GUI.

Lots of features, bug fixes, optimizations, documentation enhancements and build improvements in
this release.  Please report any problems, and, as always, enjoy!

    * 03/21/2004

Release covered-20040321 made.  This release contains lots of bug fixes and also contains the
initial version of the Covered report viewing GUI (line coverage only).  The following is a
description of the changes made since the last development release.

  - Ran C linting tool on all Covered source code and updated code based on linting errors/
    warnings.
  - Modified debug output to show file and line number of code that called the outputting
    function (easier to debug problems and useful in error regression testing).
  - Started initial error testing in regressions.
  - Several bug fixes made to remove segmentation faults and assertion errors in the new
    report generation functions.
  - Initial version of Covered report viewing GUI added.  This version displays line coverage
    only at the moment.
  - Fixed bug in score command for statement removal (was resulting in memory errors that led
    to segmentation faults).
  - Fixed bug in report command that output bad verbose information when -c option was used.
  - Added new diagnostics to regression testsuite to reproduce situations where original
    segmentation faults were found to occur.
  - Development documentation updates.  No user documentation updates are released at this
    time (other than information provided using the -h global option to Covered).

Have fun!

    * 02/11/2004

Release covered-20040210 made.  A lot of work has gone into this release to make the report
output more readable and concise.  Several bug fixes have been made as well.  A GUI is on
the way for report viewing that will be available in alpha version in the next development
release.  Below are some of the highlights of this release.

  - Added GUI interfacing functions in preparation of upcoming GUI report viewing utility.
  - Added more information about expressions to line and combinational logic coverage verbose
    information.  Rather than just outputting the RHS of the expression, the LHS and assignment
    operator (blocking or non-blocking) or IF statement are output to give the user a better
    context of the missed logic.
  - Fixed bug in param.c where parameters found in the RHS of expressions that were part of
    statements being removed were not being properly removed.
  - Fixed bug in sim.c where expressions in tree above conditional operator were not being
    evaluated if conditional expression was not at the top of tree.
  - Changed output of logic in combinational logic verbose coverage reporting to (by default)
    use the same format (in terms of endline characters) as the logic was found in the source
    code.
  - Added '-w [<line_width>]' option to report command that causes combinational logic to be
    output to report as much logic as will fit in the value of <line_width> in the report.  A
    default value of line width is specified internally in Covered to be 105 characters;
    however, the user may make this value larger or smaller to suit.  This value reverses the
    effect of the above bulletin.  Added this option to Covered's regression suite to test.
  - Completely modified output format of missing combinational logic coverage.  Removed a lot
    of coverage information that was extraneous.  When three or more subexpressions are ANDed,
    ORed, logical ANDed, or logical ORed, coverage information is output in a special way to
    increase readability/understandability for this coverage.
  - Added "GENERAL INFORMATION" section to all reports which specifies general information
    about this report (this eliminates a lot of redundant information in the report to improve
    readability).
  - Added the name of the CDD file from which a report has been generated from in the
    GENERAL INFORMATION section of the report.
  - When a CDD file is created due to merging CDD files, the names of the original CDD files
    are now stored in the merged CDD file.  This information is output in the GENERAL
    INFORMATION section of the report (created from this merged CDD file) to indicate to the
    user this information.
  - If a CDD file is created due to merging CDD files and the leading hierarchies in each of
    those CDD files are different, a bullet in the GENERAL INFORMATION specifies this and
    reminds the user that the leading hierarchy information will not be output in the rest of
    the report (instead the string "<NA>" replaces the leading hierarchy information).  This
    will help to eliminate confusion when viewing the reports and fixes an outstanding bug
    in Covered.
  - Added starting and ending line information to module structure for GUI purposes.
  - Removed scope information in CDD file for expressions, signals and statements.  This
    information was not used, caused CDD files to become excessive in size and mildly speeds
    up reading in CDD files.
  - Fixed bugs in combinational logic report section where summary coverage numbers and verbose
    coverage numbers did not agree.
  - Removed 'c' directory in 'diags' directory and cleaned up Makefile to run regressions.
  - Masked off the value of the SET bit in expressions output to CDD files.  This information
    is not needed and sometimes caused regression failures due to CDD file mismatches on
    different platforms or using different simulators.
  - Modified regression Makefile to specify the 'vvp' command prior to the compiled VVP
    executable when running Icarus Verilog regressions (due to recent change to IV).
  - Changed instance-based reports to not merge child instance coverage information into parent
    instance coverage information.  This is not done in module-based reports, makes reading
    this information confusing and doesn't provide us any extra information.
  - Fixed bug where modules were being reported in verbose reports when coverage numbers were
    100% covered.
  - Changed toggle coverage report output to output toggle information in hexidecimal format
    versus binary format.  This keeps the toggle coverage information more succinct/readable.
    Added underlines between every 4th hexidecimal value to help user's to discern the bit
    position of a toggle bit.
  - Changed the format of the report entirely to enhance readability (many changes here that
    the user will immediately see).
  - Updated user documentation for new changes and added new section called "Reading the
    Report" which will walk the user through several reports and how to interpret the report
    information.  This section is still in progress at this time.
  - Updates to development documentation.
  - Lots of new diagnostics added to regression suite.  We now have over 200 diagnostics in this
    regression.

Special note:  Please note that the CDD file format for this release has changed from previous
CDD files and is therefore incompatible with older versions.  If you try to read a CDD file
generated from an older version of Covered with the newer version, Covered will tell you that
this cannot be done due to incompatible CDD versions.

    * 11/16/2003

Release covered-20031116 made.  This development release contains a new way to specify FSMs
within the design by using inline Verilog-2001 attribute syntax.  There are also a lot of
bug fixes contained in this release as well as the usual user and development documentation
enhancements.  See the list below for more details on the changes made for this release.

  - Added better VCD parsing capability to allow bit selects to be "attached" to the signal
    names in the VCD variable definition section.  The newer versions of Icarus Verilog now
    output this format style.
  - Added ability to specify FSM location and transition information using Verilog-2001
    attributes.  Added many diagnostics to regress suite to verify this capability.
  - Fixed bug found in stable release that caused an incorrect calculation of unary operations
    performed on single-bit values.  Fixes bug 835366.
  - Fixed bug found in using constant values in the right-hand side of repetitive concatenation
    operators.  Fixes bug 832730.
  - Fixed bugs in reporting of FSM coverage information in the report command.
  - Fixed bug in FSM variable binding stage that caused incorrect coverage numbers to be reported
    for FSM coverage.
  - Fixed bug in handling variables that are too long (more than the allowed 1024 bits).  Removes
    memory corruption problems when this occurs.  Displays warning to user that it has found
    a variable that it cannot handle and gracefully disregards any logic that uses these variables.
  - Updated user documentation to include new chapter on inline attributes that Covered can
    now handle.
  - Updated development documentation for new functions added in this release.

    * 10/19/2003

Release covered-20031019 made.  Lots of modifications to existing structures and supporting
code to increase scoring speed.  In my testbenches, I am seeing about a 3-4x improvement
in speed.  Additionally, code enhancement for allowing bit selects and signal concatenations
in command-line FSM variable descriptions are now allowed.  User documentation has been
updated for these changes.  Some bug fixes are also included in this release.  The
following list shows the changes from last development release.

  - Added ability to parse more complex state "variables".  This includes the ability
    to specify single and multi-bit signals and the ability to concatenate more than
    one signal (or signal bit select) to make a state variable.  Please see user
    documentation for more information on this.
  - Minor tweaks to report format for displaying filenames (only basename of filename
    is output instead of the entire path).
  - Fixing bug in VCD parser to allow bit select parsing of a variable when the
    variable name and bit-select information are not separated by spaces (this is something
    that newer versions of Icarus Verilog now does in its VCD files).
  - Changed structure for vectors from ints to chars.  Each vector element stores information
    for one 4-state bit value and its coverage information (instead of storing 4 4-state
    variables and coverage information).  This reduces memory needed and increases calculation
    speed on vectors.
  - Fixing bug in signal_from_string function.
  - Fixing bug in arc.c related to non-zero LSBs of signals.
  - Added new parameter to info line in CDD file that specifies the format of the CDD file.
    This is used by Covered to keep CDD files with different formats from being merged, read,
    etc.
  - Removed LSB information from vector and storing this information in the signal
    structure.  Reduces memory required, enhances speed, and fixes existing bugs with bit
    selects.
  - Added more diagnostics to regression suite to test new functionality.
  - Updated user documentation for new changes.

    * 09/25/2003

Release covered-20030925 made.  This release contains the first working FSM code
coverage portion in Covered.  There is a lot more to work on in the FSM code coverage
area in the way of automatic FSM extraction and state transition specification, but
this version is able to extract FSM coverage information for an FSM that is located
by the user.  Please see user's manual for this release for more details on specifying
FSM location.  Summary and verbose reporting are available for FSM coverage at this
point.  Additionally, the data format for FSM coverage information in the CDD file
has been finalized.  FSM coverage merging is also supported in this release.  User and
development documentation has been updated.  Please give this development version a
go to get any bugs out of the FSM code coverage engine.

In addition to the FSM coverage support, a bug was fixed in the vector_to_int()
function when converting a vector whose LSB is a non-zero value.

Here is what is on the horizon for FSM coverage that you should expect to see in the
coming development releases.

  - Ability for user to specify the location of an FSM using $attribute function.
  - Ability for user to specify all possible state transitions for a given FSM on the
    command-line and using inline $attribute functions.
  - Automatic FSM extraction including locating an FSM and extracting all possible
    state transitions.

    * 08/20/2003  - Stable Release 0.2.1

Some bugs were found in the covered-0.2 release that needed to be fixed to consider
Covered to be completely stable.  This release (covered-0.2.1) contains these fixes
which are outlined below.  Please get a hold of this stable release if you have already
downloaded covered-0.2.

  - Fixing bug with the initialization of the new symtable structure.  Only 255 of the
    256 children of each node were being initialized correctly.  Fixes a segfault problem with
    the symtable_dealloc routine.
  - Fixed memory leak problem with file list in parser.  This was a long outstanding problem
    that has now been understood and fixed.
  - Added fclose() after the VCD parsing was complete.
  - Fixed a memory problem with the symtable structure that caused other data structure
    values to be corrupted.
  - Fixed assertion error problem with VCD symbol aliasing.

    * 08/16/2003

Stable release covered-0.2 finally made!  This release will be the springboard
for adding FSM coverage code, code optimizations as well as a few new features
that should make the score command run much faster.  Some important bug fixes
were made in this release and code optimizations have been added to the score
command.  If you are getting coverage for a larger design, you should definitely
notice the speed increase.  In one of my designs, the speedup was a facter of
a bit more than 3x.  The following are the list of changes made for this release.

  - Added -ts option to score command to allow the user to see where in the
    simulation process the score command is currently at.  Please see user
    documentation for more details on this new option.
  - Fixed bug with multiple wait event statements within same always block.
    This means that the CDD files created with the last version of Covered
    will be incompatible with the new CDD files.
  - Fixed bug with posedge, negedge and anyedge expressions when more than
    one of these is found in the same always block.
  - Fixed bug in vector comparison function.  Vectors will now compare to a value
    of true if the values of two vectors (whose bit size is different) are equal
    up to the smallest MSB of the two vectors.  Before, if two vectors were not
    of equal size, a compare would always evaluate to FALSE.
  - Removed unnecessary global variables.
  - Removed generated development documentation from release and opted to
    generate these with a user 'make' in the doc directory (makes release size
    smaller and is unnecessary for most users anyways).
  - Development documentation updated.
  - User documentation and man file updated.

    * 08/06/2003

Release covered-0.2pre3 made.  It has been quite a while since a release has been made
which has been due to a particularly tricky bug that was found with non-blocking
assignments.  This bug generated bad coverage information (this is considered very bad!)
This release contains bug fixes and development documentation updates.  If no more problems
are found with this release, I will get the 0.2 release made very soon.  The following
is a list of the changes for this release.

  - Fixes to line.c and toggle.c to provide better cross-platform support.
  - Lots of updates to the development documentation.
  - Fixed bug with properly handling hierarchical references in expressions.
  - Fixing bug with single-bit parameter handling (caused a diagnostic miscompare
    between Linux and Irix OS's).
  - Fixed non-blocking assignment bug.  This bug affected the order of execution in
    Covered's simulator which resulted in bad coverage information being generated.
  - Fixed bugs in divide, mod, left shift, right shift and some other expression types
    to avoid converting variables that have unknown values to integers (which results
    in Covered errors at run-time).

The list of changes is short, but the changes made are very necessary to getting reliable
coverage numbers from Covered.  Please get a copy of this version and test it out so that
we can get the stable 0.2 release made ASAP.

    * 02/18/2003

Release covered-0.2pre2 made.  Bug fixes and enhancements for allowing more Verilog
code to be parsed without spewing parsing errors.  The list of open bugs is empty at
the moment.  I will be working on enhancing the user documents and development
documents in preparation for the stable release.  The stable release will be made
next unless there are new bugs found for which the bug fixes convince me that additional
testing is necessary.  The following is a list of the changes for this release.

  - Fixed bug with copying instance trees for instances of modules that were previously
    parsed and built into the main instance tree.
  - Fixing bug in file finder so that only missing modules are displayed after the
    parsing phase is completed.
  - Updated output of filenames as they are parsed to give more consistent look.
  - Fixing bug with leftover tmp* file when missing module error is reported.
  - Adding parsing support for pullup, pulldown and gate types though these are not
    supported for coverage at the current time (probably will be supported after stable
    release).
  - Adding parsing support for real numbers in statement delays.
  - Fixing case where statement is found to be unsupported in middle of statement tree.
    The entire statement tree is removed from consideration for simulation.
  - Added preliminary support for parsing attributes though the parsing support is not
    complete at this time.
  - Fixing bug with line ordering where case statement lines were not being output
    to reports.
  - Fixing bug with statement deallocation for NULL statements within statement trees.
  - Updates to parser for new bison version 1.875
  - Added support for named blocks
  - Fixing bug with handling of preprocessor directives with leading whitespace.
  - Fixes/optimizations to db_add_statement function which avoids stack overflow errors.
  - Added check in regard to -i option to score command.  Bad -i values would cause no
    coverage information to be generated but would not tell user explicitly.  Error
    message now provided with -i option is not specified but is needed and/or -i option
    is incorrect.
  - Lots of parser updates to be able to parse UDPs, escaped identifiers, specify blocks,
    and some other various Verilog code that was causing parse errors or assertion errors.
  - Fixed proper handling of the event type.
  - Fixed bug with merging constant/parameter vector values which caused assertion error
    in report command when reporting on a merged file.
  - Fixed user error message for merge command when CDD files are unable to be read.
  - Added new type to CDD for general CDD file information.  This allows CDD files from
    different testbenches with the same DUT instantiated to be properly merged.
  - Fixed problem with generating report from CDD file that has not been scored.  Covered
    detects that the CDD file has not been scored and outputs an error message to the user
    not allowing them to generate these reports.
  - Added support for reading bit selects from VCD files (this information was previously
    ignored).  This was necessary as other simulators bit blast module ports in VCD files. 
  - Updated look of instance reports to display full hierarchy of an instance instead of
    the instance name and the instance name of the parent module.  Much easier to locate
    the instance in the design now.
  - Fixed bug with using -D/-Q option with merge command.
  - Added merge regression testing capability to regression suite.
  - Updated build environment for RedHat 8.0 requirements.
  - Updates to regression suite
  - Development documentation updates.

The way that Covered looks and feels for 0.2 stable release is set in stone now.  Please
make sure that you test this version as much as possible to get any leftover bugs out of
the code.  I only plan on updating documentation, adding code comments, and fixing bugs.
If any bugs are sent in, a 0.2pre3 release will be created, otherwise, I will make
the 0.2 stable release available.

I've got some exciting things in Covered's future in plan after 0.2 stable release,
including FSM support, new text report look, code optimizations, support to be fully
Verilog-2001 compliant, a parallel scoring algorithm, and a new GTK+ interface.
Happy testing!

    * 01/05/2003

Happy New Year!  Release covered-0.2pre1_20030105 made.  This release is primarily a
bug fix release; however, many of the bugs required larger changes than would be
expected before a stable release.  The most significant change being to the lexer which
is now split into a preprocessor and a normal lexer (before these two functions were
combined into one).  As such, this is the first prelease with a second release most
likely expected before stable release.  The following is a list of changes included in
this release.

  - Preprocessor split out from lexer to allow proper handling of defined values within
    code.
  - Added -p option to score command to allow user override of preprocessor intermediate
    output file.
  - Fixed bug where report output was not squelched when -Q global option specified on
    report command line.
  - Modified regression suite to verify CDD file generation (was being performed before),
    module report generation (new) and instance report generation (new) to make sure that
    report output was consistent.
  - Fixed bug where integer, time, real, realtime and memory data types used in expressions
    where considered to be implicitly defined and given 1-bit values.  When these types
    are seen in expressions now, they are ignored by Covered (caused nasty segfault).
  - Fixed bug when a parameterized module is instantiated more than once in a design
    (sent error message to user when this occurred).
  - Fixed bug where a parsed module that was required but not at the head of the module
    list was not being found by the parser.
  - Added internal assertions and code to verify that we never try to overrun arrays
    in the VCD parsing/running stage (caused nasty segmentation fault).
  - Reorganized code for symtable symbol lookup and value assignment.
  - Fixing bug where a parameterized module that was instantiated in a design more than
    once was not getting the correct parameter value(s).
  - Fixed module search algorithm to reparse a Verilog file that contains a module
    that was previously ignored (not needed at the time) but is later found to be
    needed.
  - Created tree.c and tree.h to handle new module search algorithm and to replace
    preprocessor define tree structure.
  - Updated development documentation.
  - Updates to user manual and manpage for new -p option, notes from this release
    and a new section that starts to describe what logic is analyzed by Covered and
    which code is not analyzed.

I've got some fairly large designs being run with this version of Covered and the regression
suite has grown to over 130 diagnostics with more on the way.  Keep the bug reports coming!

    * 12/14/2002

Release covered-20021214 made.  This release is a bug fix release.  See list below
for details.  Bugs that lead to infinite looping in the score command and segmentation
faults should now be cleared up.  Please let me know if there are any other bugs that
need to be addressed before first stable release.  Development documentation updated
to match changes in files.  Regression suite has been updated quite a bit from last
time.  There are now over 125 diagnostics in the regression suite (my goal was to
write about 100 before first stable release).

  - Segmentation fault fixes in report command
  - Parser can now handle all net types (not just wire).  Diagnostics added to regression
    suite to verify their proper handling.
  - Parser updated to handle net declaration assignments (e.g., wire a = b & c;).
    Diagnostics added to verify proper handling.
  - Added human-understandable error messages in parser to help identify file and
    line number along with a quasi-helpful error message description.
  - When parser error is found, Covered exits after parsing phase without continuing
    to write CDD file.
  - Fixed bug where a multi-bit select expression existed in a module that was
    instantiated more than once.  Assertion error fired in this case.
  - Updated regression suite for VCS testing.
  - Fixed bug where parameters were used in modules that were instantiated more than
    once.
  - Fixed bug that dealt with parameters (see param6.1.v for test case).
  - Fixed bug where a delay statement was the last statement in a statement block used
    by Covered.  Added diagnostics to verify correct behavior.
  - Fixed infinite loop problem with db_add_statement function.
  - Fixed infinite loop problem with statement_set_stop function.
  - Fixed bug with parsing order.  When an instance is found for a module that has
    already been parsed, the instance was incorrectly being handled.  Bug replicated
    with instance6.v diagnostic.
  - Fixed output of edge-triggered events to add @(...) around the expression (they
    were easily confused with other code that could exist on the same line).
  - Fixed bug in parser to not allow module to be parsed more than once.
  - Fixed bug that lead to an assertion error (see instance6.1.v for test case).
  - Fixing bug with calculating list and concatenation lengths when MBIT_SEL 
    expressions were included.
  - Changed Covered's handling of -y directories.  Before, all files in these directories
    were fed into the parser to look for missing modules.  Now, when a module is needed,
    the module name is used to find the matching filename in the -y list (basically,
    the -y option works like the -y option in Icarus Verilog and VCS).  This fix really
    streamlined the parsing phase and fixed several bugs.
  - Memory declarations are now properly ignored (produced segmentation fault previously).
  - Fixed report command to display all lines and expressions in order according to
    their line number (the problem is REALLY fixed now).
  - Removed hierarchical references from being scored.

All in all, you should notice a huge improvement in the parsing speed, syntax errors are
reported better, more Verilog syntax should be handled properly, the score command will
run a bit faster than before, and the reports should be a bit easier to read.  Segmentation
faults and assertion errors should become lesser in number (if not gone altogether?).
I am feeling pretty confident that we are getting close to a stable release as I have
been able to generate a CDD file for a chip that is millions of gates in size (CDD file
was created in the range of 30 - 45 seconds!)  Keep the bug reports coming.  I have some
things to work on for next release already.

    * 11/27/2002

Release covered-20021127 made.  This release contains mostly bug fixes to get closer
to first stable release.  In addition, it should be noted that bug fixes to allow
Covered to work on 64-bit architectures have been added.  The various bug fixes
have been listed below.  User documentation, development documentation and regress
suite has been added to and enhanced.

  - Reformatted parser.y code to make it more readable.
  - Fixed bug in parser.y that existed in 20021026 which caused the bison parser
    to either spew an error or warning
  - Fixed bug in expression resizer that caused a segmentation fault for expressions
    with NULL values in right side child expressions
  - Fixed CVS automatic log commenting.  This was causing /* to show up within
    the Log comments.  Resulted in the C compiler spewing warning messages.
  - Fixed code that handles Verilog constructs that are not supported by Covered.
    These caused segmentation faults previously.  Any code not handled by Covered
    should be ignored and cause the statement block to not be examined that contains
    the ignored code.
  - Fixed expression CDD file reader to read short numbers correctly.
  - Fixed compatibility problems between cc and gcc compilers.
  - Fixed problem that resulted in bus errors from the parser.
  - Removing compiler warnings from source and header files.  Code should now compile
    clean when the -Wall option is provided to the compiler.
  - Fixed problem where EXPAND expressions were failing when the multiplier of the
    expander was an expression itself.
  - Fixed problem with combinational logic output in the report command.
  - Fixed bug when parameters are used in expression resizing.
  - Verified that `ifdef cases work appropriately when parts of the `ifdef/`else/`endif
    are commented out (bug found in Icarus Verilog)
  - Added start of FAQ to user manual.
  - Fixed bug in report command for underlining parameters in the reports.
  - Fixed bugs with multi-bit and single-bit handling.
  - Fixed bug with combinational logic being output when it is unmeasurable.
  - Fixed bug in report command when an expression can be counted more than once.  All
    expressions are now only able to be counted and displayed once (removal of redundant
    information).
  - Fixed static expression calculation to yield proper coverage results for expressions
    containing constant values.
  - Verified -T option works correctly for min, typ, and max values.
  - Changed delay specifier to only report a warning if min/typ/max is not specified and
    we have parsed a delay with these specifiers.  Still default to typ.

Keep the bug reports coming.  I really want to get to first stable release as I have figured
out how to handle FSMs and want to start working on a GUI front-end for the report command.

    * 10/26/2002

Release covered-20021026 finally made.  This release is an enormous step toward
getting to first stable release.  Added support for parameters which should be
complete for stable release.  Supports all Verilog-1995 standard parameter code.
This caused some parts of the code to be completely redesigned and in the process
enhanced the efficiency of the score command.  Additional enhancements and bug fixes
are so numerous that I will list them below:

  - Fixed bug in VCD for reading $var definitions containing optional bit selects
  - Fixed bug with calculating initial values of signals for all simulators
  - Fixed bug with coverage results for static values.
  - Modified regression to run with Icarus Verilog or VCS.
  - Full support parameters as specified for Verilog-1995 (Verilog-2000 will be supported
    in the future) -- simple bullet in list but a lot of work involved here.
  - Fixing bug with concatenations specified on the left-hand-side of equations
  - Fixed several other bugs in handling concatenations.
  - Added lots of new diagnostics to regression suite to test parameters and other
    Verilog components which were found to be buggy.
  - Fixed bugs with single and mult-bit signal selects.  Multi-bit select bugs were
    causing internal assertion errors to fire.
  - Expressions changed to be more efficient with memory consumption.
  - Added ability to parse real types in VCD dumpfiles (though real numbers are not
    supported internally) -- VCD dumpfile parsing should be complete now.
  - Fixing -i option in score command to use full Verilog hierarchy rather than just
    the instance name (this was the intended behavior).
  - Added -T option to allow user to select min, typ, or max delay values in
    min:typ:max delay statements.
  - Fixed bug leading to segmentation fault in report command when outputting verbose
    information for large expression trees.
  - Added initial fix for ordering line and combinational logic outputs in verbose
    reports (they were backwards before).
  - Updates to development documentation, user manual, and man page for new features
    and redescribed a few things in user manual for clarification purposes.

Overall, this is a MAJOR release.  Please give this one a try and submit bug reports.
I only have a few more small features to add before first stable release so I want to
really work the problems out of this release.  All Verilog code that Covered will
pay attention to in a design for the Verilog-1995 standard is now in place.  A lot of
work went into this release -- thus the delay in getting the release out.

    * 9/14/2002

Release covered-20020914 made.  This release is mostly a feature release with a few
bug fixes in place.  Code has been added and development documentation started to
handle parameters.  To make Covered as efficient as possible in the score command,
certain unnecessary steps were removed; however, this makes supporting parameters
more complicated to code.  I am narrowing in on the implementation but as of yet
parameter support is not included in this release.  The next release should provide
support for parameters.  I did make some progress on checking off a few of the things
on the TODO list before first stable release.  I have added the initial version of 
combinational logic depth control.  When the -v option was present, all subexpressions 
found to be not fully covered where output for combinational logic.  This type of 
output, though very useful, was somewhat too verbose to gain an understanding of 
initial coverage information.  To remedy the situation, I have removed the -v option 
and added the -d (detail control) option which may take the following parameters:  
s, summary output only; d, detail output (intermediate verbose output); and v, verbose 
output (same as the old -v option).  The information contained in detailed output is 
similar to most commercial coverage tools that I have used.  The -d v option will 
provide that "over the top" information as to exactly what subexpressions where not 
fully covered.  Additionally, bug fixes were made to the -c option to the report command, 
and MULTIPLY, DIVIDE and MOD expressions should now be output in detailed and verbose 
reports.  Fixed bug with initial value of signals that was causing Covered to report 
incorrect coverage results for signals that were not initialized and not toggled during 
simulation.  Updated regression test suite for all changes mentioned above and updated 
user, manpage and development documentation.

    * 8/22/2002

Release covered-20020822 finally made.  Took some time off away from the project to get
some other chores done and get refreshed.  This release contains mostly bug fixes that I
have found while testing the tool on some "real" logic.  The CDD database merging (used
in the merge and report commands) was rewritten for optimization purposes and to remove
a hard-to-pin-down segmentation fault.  As a result, merging CDD files and generating
reports should be a bit faster and the bizarre bug should be eliminated.  Fixed some
bugs in Verilog parser to generate user error/warning messages instead of core dumping.
Also added -c option to report command that allows the user (and maintainer) to generate
a report that shows what code is covered (instead of the default behavior to show what is
uncovered).  This is useful for debugging and understanding exactly what the tool is
capable of measuring.  Removed Bison generated VCD parser and replaced it with an optimized,
hand-written VCD parser.  This should make reading in the VCD file much faster and should
totally eliminate any problems in reading in these files.  Added manpage as an additional 
documentation source and updated Makefiles to install this manpage.  Updated user
documentation and development documentation.

    * 7/21/2002

Release covered-20020721 made.  Lots of bug fixes and feature enhancements.  Fixed output
to a more understandable format when modules cannot be found during parsing.  Added support
for the -e option which allows the user to omit modules from coverage.  Fixed single and
multi-bit selectors.  These should work properly now, selecting the correct values from
vectors.  Added -D option to allow the user define values at the command-line.  Fixed
problems associated with the `ifdef/`ifndef directives.  Fixed problem with module trees
that were 3 or more modules deep.  Created TODO list for items that I want to complete
before 0.1 stable release.  This will give users/developers an insight to the short-term
goals of the project.  All items in TODO list preceded by an X have also been worked on
in this release.  Improved performance of signal/expression binding.  Support has been
added to allow implicit wire declarations.  Added ability to parse the design and score
the dumpfile in two calls to the score command.  This could aid performance later as a
design would only need to be parsed once.  More diagnostics have been added to the
Verilog test suite.  Development and user documentation has been updated to bring them
up-to-date with current functionality.

    * 7/15/2002

Release covered-20020715 made.  Several bug fixes for problems found in previous release
and additional Verilog constructs are now supported.  The `ifdef, `else, and `endif
directives are now supported.  VCD scoping problems have been dealt with.  It should be
possible now to get coverage results on an entire tree of Verilog instances.  It should
also be possible to provide a dumpfile that contains more information than is necessary
for getting coverage.  Some performance improvements have been made that will be noticeable
for larger designs.  Fixed bugs for always statements that did not contain any coverage-able
code.  Support is now in place for concatenation and replication in operations.  The
binding phase has been revamped to provide better performance, easier maintenance and
less memory consumption.  New diagnostics have been added to start testing new code support.
Full regression passes.

    * 7/11/2002

Release covered-20020711 made.  This release contains a lot of fixes to the score and report
commands.  Proper support for `include and `define preprocessor now available.  Fixes to the
-y, -I, and -f options to score command.  These now seem to working correctly.  Added -D and
-Q options to covered (for score, merge and report commands) for adjusting amount of output
to the screen.  The -D option causes debug information to be spewed to standard output for
debugging tool problems (not recommended for standard usage).  The -Q option will omit all
output to standard output (stderr is still displayed).  By default, the minimal amount of output
is displayed to show tool progress.  Added proper support for default case, casex and casez
statements.  Fixed a lot of problems in the report command output, including reformatting the
toggle information to help make this more readable.  Lots of bug fixes and support enhancements
make upgrading to this version worthwhile.

    * 7/6/2002

Second release of Covered (covered-20020706) made.  Proper support for case, casex and casez
now exists and has been tested to an extent.  Fixed problem with reading VCD files appropriately.
Support for multi-bit anyedge (i.e., always @(b) ...) is now installed.  Lots of other bugs
in the first release have been fixed.  I have noticed a small performance degradation by changing
the VCD reader and am looking into it.  All in all, this release fixes many bugs and enhances
support for case statements and always blocks.

    * 7/3/2002

Finally release first unstable version of Covered in tarball format. This version should 
be considered alpha at this point but may be considered ready for good testing. Please 
read the release note that accompanies the pointer to the download for information on what 
type of code is currently supported for testing purposes. Happy bug finding!

    * 6/19/2002

Added beginnings of development on-line documentation. At the moment, this documentation 
mostly lays out the ground-work for interested developers. Lots of details are missing at 
the moment; though, the generated documentation contains a lot of source-code-specific 
information. With initial documentation out of the way, for the most part, the first 
release should be right around the corner.

    * 5/1/2002

Added user on-line manual. The download still isn't available for use; however, it may be 
interesting to see how the tool will be used. By the way, the download should be available 
soon for first release. All of the features may not be present but it should be somewhat 
usable.

    * 4/12/2002

Created a home for the Covered utility on SourceForge.net. Currently, the HTML website is 
only available for viewing. No downloads are yet available. There are a few features that 
need to be added to the tool (and verification of those and other parts) before the source 
files and tool become available for public use. Check out the ToDo page for items that are 
on my todo list before making the tool available on-line!

    * 11/27/2001

Started working on the Covered utility. After searching long and hard for a free, open 
source code coverage utility and coming up empty, decided to start working on one. This 
utility will be available on the gEDA website and database.
