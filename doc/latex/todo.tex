Page {\bf What is on the Covered todo list} ]
Enhance Verilog code parser to allow coverage on more of the language. 

Add support to handle Finite State Machines. The initial available versions of Covered will not include FSM coverage metrics. 

Currently expressions that contain only static variables are not measured in coverage due to the fact that a static variable is not included in a dumpfile, thus the expression will never get placed into the runtime expression queue (thus no line coverage performed). Static values should be measured. Support for these expressions will be added in the future. 

 Work on verbose reporting for all coverage metrics. \end{description}
