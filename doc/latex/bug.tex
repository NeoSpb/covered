Member {\bf signal\_\-db\_\-read}(char $\ast$$\ast$line, module $\ast$curr\_\-mod) ]
A signal will only look in the current module for a matching expression. In the case of a hierarchical reference, it is possible that an expression outside the current module is referencing this signal. We need to check for this case (hierarchical expression) and find the expression elsewhere.\end{description}
