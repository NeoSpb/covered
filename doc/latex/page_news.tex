 Created a home for the Covered utility on Source\-Forge.net. Currently, the generated HTML files are only available for viewing. No downloads are yet available. There are a few features that need to be added to the tool (and verification of those and other parts) before the source files and tool become available for public use. Check out the To\-Do page for items that are on my todo list before making the tool available online!

 Started working on the Covered utility. After searching long and hard for a free, open source code coverage utility and coming up empty, decided to start working on one. This utility will be available on the g\-EDA website and database.
