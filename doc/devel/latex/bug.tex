 \begin{description}
\item[Member {\bf do\_\-define} () ]This strips trailing line comments out of the definition. It's not adequate as the \char`\"{}//\char`\"{} may have been quoted or commented, but it will do for now.\end{description}


\label{_bug000002}
 \begin{description}
\item[Member {\bf signal\_\-db\_\-read} (char $\ast$$\ast$line, module $\ast$curr\_\-mod) ]A signal will only look in the current module for a matching expression. In the case of a hierarchical reference, it is possible that an expression outside the current module is referencing this signal. We need to check for this case (hierarchical expression) and find the expression elsewhere.\end{description}

 \begin{description}
\item[Member {\bf directory\_\-load} (char $\ast$dir, str\_\-link $\ast$ext\_\-head, str\_\-link $\ast$$\ast$file\_\-head, str\_\-link $\ast$$\ast$file\_\-tail) ]Need to order files according to extension first instead of filename.\end{description}
