Mailing List
</_header2>

<_pg>
The Covered project has a user mailing list.  Whenever there are
stable releases being made of the project, an e-mail will get
sent out to this list stating the new release is available.
Additionally, the mailing list is a great way to bring up usability
issues with the tool and, of course, bugs.  The mailing list
can also be useful if you have a question about using Covered --
there is probably someone else who has encountered the same
problem that might be able to provide you with some help.

Copyright and Licensing
</_header2>

<_pg>
This program is distributed under the GNU Public License GPL.

<_header3>
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
</_header3>

<_overview>
<i>Version 2, June 1991</i>
</_overview>

<_pg>
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 675 
Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA Everyone is permitted to 
copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, 
but changing it is not allowed.
</_pg>

<_header4>
Preamble
</_header4>

<_pg>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your 
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General 
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share 
and change free software-to make sure the software is free for 
all its users. This General Public License applies to most of 
the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other 
program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free 
Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library 
General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your 
programs, too.
</_pg>

<_pg>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, 
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make 
sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free 
software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you 
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can 
change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; 
and that you know you can do these things.
</_pg>

<_pg>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that 
forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to 
surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain 
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the 
software, or if you modify it.


</_pg>

<_pg>
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, 
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients 
all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, 
too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show 
them these terms so they know their rights.
</_pg>

<_pg>
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the 
software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal 
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

</_pg>

<_pg>
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make 
certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty 
for this free software. If the software is modified by someone 
else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what 
they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
by others will not reflect on the original authors' 
reputations.

</_pg>

<_pg>
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software 
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a 
free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in 
effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we 
have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for 
everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

</_pg>

<_pg>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
modification follow.

</_pg>

<_header4>
Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distribution, and Modification
</_header4>

<_pg>
<ol type="1"> 
  <li>[0.] This License applies to any program or other work 
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder 
saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General 
Public License. The ``Program'', below, refers to any such 
program or work, and a ``work based on the Program'' means 
either the Program or any derivative work under copyright 
law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a 
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation 
is included without limitation in the term ``modification''.) 
Each licensee is addressed as ``you''. 
  <p> 
  Activities other than copying, distribution and 
modification are not covered by this License; they are 
outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not 
restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only 
if its contents constitute a work based on the Program 
(independent of having been made by running the Program). 
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
  <p> 
  <li>[1.] You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of 
the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on 
each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of 
warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this 
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any 
other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along 
with the Program. 
  <p> 
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring 
a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection 
in exchange for a fee. 
  <p> 
  <li>[2.] You may modify your copy or copies of the Program 
or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the 
Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work 
under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also 
meet all of these conditions: 
  <p> 
  <ol type="a"> 
    <li>[a.] You must cause the modified files to carry 
prominent notices stating that you changed the files and 
the date of any change. 
    <p> 
    <li>[b.] You must cause any work that you distribute or 
publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived 
from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a 
whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of 
this License. 
    <p> 
    <li>[c.] If the modified program normally reads commands 
interactively when run, you must cause it, when started 
running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, 
to print or display an announcement including an appropriate 
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or 
else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users 
may redistribute the program under these conditions, and 
telling the user how to view a copy of this License. 
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does 
not normally print such an announcement, your work based on 
the Program is not required to print an announcement.) 
  </ol>
  <p> 
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. 
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from 
the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent 
and separate works in themselves, then this License, and 
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you 
distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute 
the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based 
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the 
terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees 
extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part 
regardless of who wrote it. 
  <p> 
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights 
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; 
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the 
distribution of derivative or collective works based on the 
Program. 
  <p> 
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on 
the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the 
Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium 
does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License. 
  <p>
  <li>[3.] You may copy and distribute the Program (or a 
work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or 
executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above 
provided that you also do one of the following: 
  <p> 
  <ol type="a"> 
    <li>[a.] Accompany it with the complete corresponding 
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed 
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
customarily used for software interchange; or,
    <p>
    <li>[b.] Accompany it with a written offer, valid for 
at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge 
no more than your cost of physically performing source 
distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the 
corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms 
of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for 
software interchange; or, 
    <p>
    <li>[c.] Accompany it with the information you received 
as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. 
(This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial 
distribution and only if you received the program in object 
code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with 
Subsection b above.) 
  </ol>
  <p> 
  The source code for a work means the preferred form of 
the work for making modifications to it. For an executable 
work, complete source code means all the source code for all
 modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control 
compilation and installation of the executable. However, as 
a special exception, the source code distributed need not 
include anything that is normally distributed (in either 
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, 
kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the 
executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies 
the executable. 
  <p>
  If distribution of executable or object code is made by 
offering access to copy from a designated place, then 
offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the 
same place counts as distribution of the source code, even 
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source 
along with the object code.
  <li>[4.] You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or 
distribute the Program except as expressly provided under 
this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will 
automatically terminate your rights under this License. 
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from 
you under this License will not have their licenses 
terminated so long as such parties remain in full 
compliance. 
  <p>
  <li>[5.] You are not required to accept this License, 
since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants 
you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its 
derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you 
do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or 
distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and 
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or 
modifying the Program or works based on it.
  <p>
  <li>[6.] Each time you redistribute the Program (or any 
work based on the Program), the recipient automatically 
receives a license from the original licensor to copy, 
distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and 
conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on 
the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You 
are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third 
parties to this License.
  <p>
  <li>[7.] If, as a consequence of a court judgment or 
allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason 
(not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on 
you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you 
cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your 
obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute 
the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would 
not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all 
those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
 then the only way you could satisfy both it and this 
License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of 
the Program.
  <p>
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or 
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance 
of the section is intended to apply and the section as a 
whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
  <p>
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to 
infringe any patents or other property right claims or to 
contest validity of any such claims; this section has the 
sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free 
software distribution system, which is implemented by public 
license practices. Many people have made generous 
contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
through that system in reliance on consistent application of 
that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or 
she is willing to distribute software through any other 
system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
  <p>
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is 
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 
  <p>
  <li>[8.] If the distribution and/or use of the Program is 
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by 
copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who 
places the Program under this License may add an explicit 
geographical distribution limitation excluding those 
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or 
among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this 
License incorporates the limitation as if written in the 
body of this License.
  <p>
  <li>[9.] The Free Software Foundation may publish revised 
and/or new versions of the General Public License from time 
to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the 
present version, but may differ in detail to address new 
problems or concerns.
  <p>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If 
the Program specifies a version number of this License which 
applies to it and ``any later version'', you have the option 
of following the terms and conditions either of that version 
or of any later version published by the Free Software 
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number 
of this License, you may choose any version ever published 
by the Free Software Foundation.
  <p>
  <li>[10.] If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program 
into other free programs whose distribution conditions are 
different, write to the author to ask for permission. For 
software which is copyrighted by the Free Software 
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we 
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be 
guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all 
derivatives of our free software and of promoting the 
sharing and reuse of software generally.
  <p>
  <p><br>
  <p><br>
  <center> NO WARRANTY</center><br>
  <p>
  <li>[11.] BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, 
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT 
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED 
IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ``AS IS'' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, 
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM 
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY 
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  <p>
  <li>[12.] IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW 
OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY 
OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM 
AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING 
ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES 
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM 
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING 
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD 
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY 
OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS 
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
  <p> 
</ol>
<p align=center> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p><br>

Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
</_header4>

<_pg>
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the 
greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve 
this is to make it free software which everyone can 
redistribute and change under these terms.
</_pg>

<_pg>
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is 
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most 
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file 
should have at least the ``copyright'' line and a pointer to 
where the full notice is found.

</_pg>
