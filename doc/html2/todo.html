<dt><a name="_todo000001"></a>Page <a class="el" href="page_todo.html">What is on the Covered todo list</a> <dd>Work on verbose reporting for all coverage metrics. 
<p>
Add support for statements in Verilog parser. Currently, only expressions are handled correctly by the parser. Expressions are not contingent upon anything else besides signal changes within the expression to be added the the run-time engine. Statements are required to handle ordering of expressions. 
<p>
Add combinational logic coverage handling to report structure. Currently, line and toggle coverage are handled in summary form. 
<p>
Enhance Verilog code parser to allow coverage on more of the language. 
<p>
Add support to handle Finite State Machines. The initial available versions of Covered will not include FSM coverage metrics. 
<p>
Provide GUI for generating/parsing reports. The GUI will allow users to quickly see what is covered and what is not covered (without being as messy as a large text file).
