<hr><a name="page_todo"><h2>What is on the Covered todo list</h2></a>

<p>
 Items that need to be completed before initial release of this utility/source code.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Work on verbose reporting for all coverage metrics.<li>Add support for statements in Verilog parser. Currently, only expressions are handled correctly by the parser. Expressions are not contingent upon anything else besides signal changes within the expression to be added the the run-time engine. Statements are required to handle ordering of expressions.<li>Add combinational logic coverage handling to report structure. Currently, line and toggle coverage are handled in summary form.</ol>

<p>
 The following are items that are on the todo list after the above have been completed. Some of them are long term features that I want as part of this tool.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Enhance Verilog code parser to allow coverage on more of the language.<li>Add support to handle Finite State Machines. The initial available versions of Covered will not include FSM coverage metrics.<li>Provide GUI for generating/parsing reports. The GUI will allow users to quickly see what is covered and what is not covered (without being as messy as a large text file).</ol>

<p>
 If you have any other things that you would like to see put into these lists, let me know at <a href="mailto:trevorw@charter.net.">trevorw@charter.net.</a>
