      The merge command is initiated with the following call:
    </p><p>
      <code class="code">covered merge [<span class="emphasis"><em>options</em></span>] <span class="emphasis"><em>existing_CDD</em></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>CDD_to_merge</em></span>+</code>
    </p><p>
      The <span class="emphasis"><em>existing_CDD</em></span> specifier relates to any existing CDD. If the -o option is not specified (see
      below for details), this file will be replaced with the merged CDD created by the merge. This is important to
      remember since merging is an irreversible operation (apart from generating a brand-new CDD from the design and
      dumpfile using the score command).
    </p><p>
      The <span class="emphasis"><em>CDD_to_merge</em></span> specifier relates to any existing CDD that is not the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>existing_CDD</em></span>. Though it is not illegal to merge the same CDD to itself, the result is the same
      as the original CDD. Note that all files treated as <span class="emphasis"><em>CDD_to_merge</em></span> are guaranteed not to be
      modified by the merge command. These files are only read by Covered and then merged into the information contained
      in the <span class="emphasis"><em>existing_CDD</em></span>.

                  Specifies how to handle exclusion reason resolution.  If two or more CDD files being merged have exclusion
                  reasons specified for the same coverage point, the exclusion reason needs to be resolved (unless it is the
                  same string value).  If this option is not specified and a conflict is found, Covered will interactively
                  request input for each exclusion as to how to handle it.  If this option is specified, it tells Covered
                  how to handle all exclusion reason conflicts.  The values are as follows:

      In previous versions of Covered, merging could only be accomplished when the top-most scored modules of each CDD
      were the same the module.  Typically, the user would score the entire DUT in each diagnostic run, creating a set of
      CDD files that could be merged together to see the overall coverage of the diagnostic runs.  While this capability
      still exists, Covered has recently been enhanced to allow more complex merging which provides some new capabilities.
    </p><p>
      Covered's merging algorithms have now been enhanced to allow merging CDDs that are generated for different parts
      of the same DUT.  That is to say that each instance or sub-tree in the design can be scored individually and can be
      merged together.  This ability allows for the DUT to be split up into smaller parts, scored in parallel and then merged
      back together to create a single CDD containing the scored results for the entire DUT.  This parallel scoring capability
      can now be used to speed up scoring of large designs by taking advantage of multiple CPUs or CPU cores.
    </p><p>
      In addition to allowing for parallel scoring, this merge method allows users to gain coverage results for smaller
      parts of the design and merge them into a single CDD containing coverage results for the entire design.  This can be
      advantageous for those that are focused on increasing coverage for a specific portion of the design.  Scoring can be
      done on that small part and the coverage gained can be added into an existing CDD containing coverage information for
      the entire design.
    </p><p>
      Along with the capability to merge different portions of the same large design, it is also possible to merge CDDs that
      were generated from different testbenches but have modules that are in common with each other.  This allows different
      teams to work together to enhance coverage for shared design blocks.  It is important to note that when this type of
      merging is being performed that the top-most covered module in the CDDs labeled <span class="emphasis"><em>CDD_to_merge</em></span> exist
      exactly once in the CDD labeled <span class="emphasis"><em>existing_CDD</em></span> for instance coverage information to be reported
      correctly.  If the module is instantiated more than once in the <span class="emphasis"><em>existing_CDD</em></span>, the CDD will still
      be merged but only the module coverage information will be correct.
