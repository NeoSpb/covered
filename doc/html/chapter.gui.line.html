  Line coverage is the quickest way to determine what logic in your design is being exercised and which logic has not 
  be exercised during simulation.  If a line was found to not be simulated, this is an indication that there was some 
  event that did not occur or did not occur at the proper time to cause a previous conditional expression to be 
  evaluated to true or false.  For example, if a block of code looked something like:
  </p><p>
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  always @(posedge clock)  // Line 1
    if( a )                // Line 2
      b &lt;= 1'b0;           // Line 3
    else                   // Line 4
      b &lt;= 1'b1;           // Line 5
    </pre><p>
  </p><p>
  If line 3 was shown to be not covered, this would indicate that at the positive edge of the term "clock", the value 
  of "a" never evaluated to a value of 1 (true).  To make line 3 become covered, we would need to setup a situation in 
  the diagnostic that caused "a" to become true at the positive edge of the term "clock".
  </p><p>
  On the other hand, if all lines 2 - 5 were found to be uncovered, this would indicate the the term "clock" never made 
  a transition from some value to a 1 (true) value during simulation.

    To view line coverage for all uncovered lines for a specific module/instance, do the following:
    </p><p>
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
          Make sure that the <span class="bold"><strong>Show Uncovered</strong></span> menu item in the 
          <a href="chapter.gui.main.html#section.gui.main.reportmenu">Report</a> is selected.
          </p></li><li><p>
          Select the line coverage metric in the <a href="chapter.gui.main.html#section.gui.main.covbar">The Coverage Type View Bar</a> by left-clicking on selection 
          button to the left of "Line".
          </p></li><li><p>
          Select one of the modules/instances that is highlighted in the uncovered color scheme (to change this color 
          scheme, see <a href="chapter.gui.preferences.html">Navigating the Preferences Window</a>) in the <a href="chapter.gui.main.html#section.gui.main.listbox">Module/Instance Listbox</a>.  This 
          will cause the selected module/instance source code to be displayed in the 
          <a href="chapter.gui.main.html#section.gui.main.viewer">Coverage File Viewer</a>.
          </p></li></ol></div><p>
    </p><p>
    Once the selected module/instance has been displayed, scroll down in the Coverage File Viewer window (using the 
    scroll bars to the right and below the Coverage File Viewer window) until you have reached a line that is 
    highlighted in the uncovered color scheme. The line number of the highlighted line will be printed to the left of 
    the source code line.  This line represents a line that was found to not be hit during the simulation of this 
    module/instance.
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section.gui.line.excl"></a>17.2. Excluding/Included Uncovered Lines from Line Coverage</h2></div></div></div><p>
    Any uncovered line in the design may be included/excluded from coverage consideration.  To the left of each 
    uncovered line is an underlined "I" (line is included in coverage) or "E" (line is excluded in coverage). Clicking 
    on this character will change the coverage exclusion property of the line by recalculating the summary line 
    coverage information, redisplaying it in the <a href="chapter.gui.main.html#section.gui.main.listbox">Module/Instance Listbox</a>, changing the background 
    color of the line from the uncovered background color to the covered background color, and changing the leftmost 
    character of the line to the opposite value to indicate its current status. 
    <a href="chapter.gui.line.html#figure.gui.line.include">Example of uncovered line included for line coverage consideration</a> shows an uncovered line that is included for coverage consideration. 
    <a href="chapter.gui.line.html#figure.gui.line.exclude">Example of uncovered line excluded for line coverage consideration</a> shows the same line which is now excluded from coverage consideration.
    </p><p>
      </p><div class="figure"><a name="figure.gui.line.include"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 17.1. Example of uncovered line included for line coverage consideration</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="img/line_incl.gif" alt="Example of uncovered line included for line coverage consideration"></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break">

    </p><p>
    In addition to changing the line coverage information, the combinational logic coverage information for an 
    uncovered statement on that line will also be implicitly excluded from coverage (though the exclude properties for 
    each subexpression of the statement will not change).
    </p><p>
    If the user excludes any line in the design, the <span class="bold"><strong>Save CDD...</strong></span> option in the 
    <a href="chapter.gui.main.html#section.gui.main.filemenu">File</a> menu will be enabled.  This allows the user to save the excluded property 
    either back to the CDD file (or to a newly named CDD file). Doing so will allow the user to load the CDD file at a 
    different time and retain the knowledge of which lines have been excluded/included for coverage.  Additionally, if 
    a saved CDD file with coverage exclusion is merged with another CDD file, the excluded line information is 
    preserved for the resulting merged CDD file.

          </p></li></ol></div><p>

    Once the selected module/instance has been displayed, scroll down in the Coverage File Viewer window (using the
