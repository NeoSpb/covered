  The Verbose Assertion Coverage window allows the user to see exactly which coverage points were hit or missed for a 
  selected assertion instantiation in the design and, if hit, how many times the assertion coverage point (ACP) was hit 
  during simulation.  Additionally, this window allows you to bring up the <a class="xref" href="chapter.gui.assert.source.html" title="Chapter 23. Navigating the Assertion Source Code Window">Navigating the Assertion Source Code Window</a> 
  to view the internal assertion module code for the currently selected assertion instance. This lets the user view the 
  code to determine what logically needs to occur to hit a given ACP.
  </p><p>
  To view this window, select the "Assert" mode in the <a class="xref" href="chapter.gui.main.html#section.gui.main.covbar" title="16.2. The Coverage Type View Bar">Section 16.2, &#8220;The Coverage Type View Bar&#8221;</a> in the main window and 
  click on an underlined assertion instance name in the <a class="xref" href="chapter.gui.main.html#section.gui.main.viewer" title="16.4. The Coverage File Viewer">Section 16.4, &#8220;The Coverage File Viewer&#8221;</a>. Note that both 
  covered and uncovered assertion instance names can be selected. Doing so will cause the Verbose Assertion Coverage 
  Window to be displayed for the selected assertion instantiation.  <a class="xref" href="chapter.gui.assert.html#figure.gui.assert" title="Figure 22.1. Verbose Assertion Coverage Window">Verbose Assertion Coverage Window</a> shows an example 
  of a zero_one_hot assertion that had the "test_expr_change covered" ACP covered (hit twice during simulation) and the 
  other two ACPs uncovered during simulation.

    The window is made up of a simple table which contains the coverage point names within the selected assertion on 
    the left and the number of times each of these coverage points were hit during simulation on the right. If a 
    coverage point has not been hit, both the coverage point name and the number of hits (0) will be highlighted with 
    the "uncovered" color selection as selected in the <a class="xref" href="chapter.gui.preferences.html" title="Chapter 27. Navigating the Preferences Window">Navigating the Preferences Window</a>. If a coverage point 
    has been hit at least once, both the coverage point name and the number of hits will be highlighted with the 
    "covered" color selection as selected in the Preferences window.
    </p><p>
    Below the table the name of the currently selected assertion type is named.  To view the source code for this 
    assertion, simply click on the <span class="bold"><strong>Show Code</strong></span> button at the bottom right-hand portion 
    of the coverage table.  This will cause the source code for this assertion to be displayed in a new 
    <a class="xref" href="chapter.gui.assert.source.html" title="Chapter 23. Navigating the Assertion Source Code Window">Navigating the Assertion Source Code Window</a>.

    To exit this window, simply click on <span class="bold"><strong>Close</strong></span> button. To see this help page for the 
    assertion coverage window, click on the <span class="bold"><strong>Help</strong></span> button.

    Individual ACPs can be excluded/included for coverage consideration using the verbose assertion coverage window. 
    This is accomplished by clicking on the "0" (ACP is currently included in coverage) or "E" (ACP is current excluded 
    from coverage) value in the "# of hits" column.  Changing an ACP from "0" to "E" (excluding the ACP from coverage 
    consideration) will cause the summary assertion coverage information to be recalculated and redisplayed in the 
    <a class="xref" href="chapter.gui.main.html#section.gui.main.listbox" title="16.3. The Module/Instance Listbox">Section 16.3, &#8220;The Module/Instance Listbox&#8221;</a> and the background color of the ACP will change from the uncovered to the 
    covered background color.  Changing an ACP from "E" to "0" (including the ACP for coverage consideration) will 
    cause the summary assertion coverage information to be recalculated and redisplayed in the Main Window Summary Bar 
    and background color of the ACP will change from the covered to the uncovered background color. 
    <a class="xref" href="chapter.gui.assert.html#figure.gui.assert.exclude" title="Figure 22.2. Example of excluded ACP">Example of excluded ACP</a> below shows the above assertion instance with the last coverage point 
    excluded from coverage.

    </p><p>
    If all ACPs for a given assertion instance have been excluded from coverage consideration, the 
    <a class="xref" href="chapter.gui.main.html#section.gui.main.viewer" title="16.4. The Coverage File Viewer">Section 16.4, &#8220;The Coverage File Viewer&#8221;</a> will automatically change the background color of the assertion instance 
    name from the uncovered to the covered background color.  The assertion instance name will still be underlined, 
    allowing the user to still see the coverage information for that given assertion instance.
    </p><p>
    If the user excludes any ACP in the design, the <span class="bold"><strong>Save CDD...</strong></span> option in the 
    <a class="xref" href="chapter.gui.main.html#section.gui.main.filemenu" title="The File Menu">the section called &#8220;The File Menu&#8221;</a> menu will be enabled.  This allows the user to save the excluded 
    property either back to the CDD file (or to a newly named CDD file).  Doing so will allow the user to load the CDD 
    file at a different time and retain the knowledge of which ACPs have been excluded/included for coverage. 
    Additionally, if a saved CDD file with coverage exclusion is merged with another CDD file, the excluded ACP 
    information is preserved for the resulting merged CDD file.

    If the Verbose Assertion Coverage window is currently displayed, the user may select a new assertion in the 
    <a class="xref" href="chapter.gui.main.html#section.gui.main.viewer" title="16.4. The Coverage File Viewer">Section 16.4, &#8220;The Coverage File Viewer&#8221;</a> of the Main window. When a new assertion is selected, its information 
    immediately replaces the currently selected assertion. This feature allows many different assertions to be viewed 
    one after the other without having to create/destroy a new window for each.
    </p><p>
    The user may also see the previous or next uncovered assertion in the main viewer by clicking either the left arrow 
    button (for previous signal viewing) or the right arrow button (for next signal viewing).  Note that the left arrow 
    button will be disabled if there is not a signal previous to the current signal in the given module and the right 
    arrow button will be disabled if there is not a signal after the current signal in the given module.
