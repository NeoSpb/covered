      For a design to pass full coverage, it is recommended that the write/read memory coverage 
      for all modules in a design receive 100% coverage.  If every AME was not both written and
      read during simulation, the design has not been fully exercised.  Toggle coverage per AME
      need not receive 100% since a memory element that is written once will not cause toggle
      coverage to change.</P>
