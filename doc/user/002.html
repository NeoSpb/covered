      Typically, in the design verification work flow, a design verification engineer 
      will develop a self-checking test suite to verify design elements/functions

      It is important to note that any code coverage tool is only useful in indicating 
      how much logic is being covered by a test suite. It does not indicate that the 
      covered logic works appropriately. This, of course, can only be verified by the 
      diagnostics themselves.</P>

      Additionally, it is possible that two or more diagnostics can achieve the same 
      coverage and yet be functionally testing different characteristics of a design. 
      Since the coverage metrics are not improved in this case, one may conclude that 
      the second test is unnecessary. This may or may not be true depending on what 
      is being tested; it is always up to the test writer to determine the necessity 
      of a diagnostic. Using the code coverage tool results as the sole means of 
      making this determination is not recommended. Use common sense in these areas.</P>

      Covered is a tool that uses your design files along with standard VCD or LXT
      dump files to analyze the code coverage of the DUT. The code coverage information 
      is stored in a special database file that can be retrieved and "merged" with new 
      coverage information to create a summed coverage total for several tests. After a 
      database file has been created, the user may generate various ASCII reports that 
      summarize the coverage information or run Covered's GUI to interactively analyze
      the coverage information.</P>

      Though Covered does perform some resimulation of the design to derive line,
      combinational logic, memory, and assertion coverage, Covered is NOT a
      full-fledged compiler/simulator and should not be used for such purposes.
      Additionally, Covered is NOT a linting tool.  Many syntax/semantic issues that
      are not allowed by the LRM are allowed by Covered for purposes of making
      Covered's core more generic and/or simplistic.  Please make sure that your
      code is properly linted in your design flow using an appropriate tool.</P>

      Most Verilog code coverage tools perform a pre-compilation procedure known as 
      instrumenting. During this procedure, the coverage tool will read in the DUT 
      and generate its own version of the DUT with additional code added to aid in 
      calculating coverage after the simulation is complete. The benefits to this 
      style are higher performance of the coverage tool when it is run after the 
      simulation. The drawbacks to this approach are that it slows down simulation 
      speed and a trust issue that the coverage tool did not alter your simulation 
      model when it performed the instrumentation.</P>

      Covered, on the other hand, omits the instrumenting procedure all-together 
      and only performs its analysis on a pre-simulated design. This means that 
      Covered cannot make a mistake to your simulation and the simulation is allowed 
      to run faster since there is no additional code that must be run to get 
      coverage data. The drawback is that there is some overhead in post-simulation 
      for extracting coverage data but this is typically less than the simulation 
      overhead in the other method.</P>

      Additionally, unlike all other commercial coverage tools, Covered is free! No 
      license managers to invoke and maintain. No licensing fees and negotiations. 
      The only thing the developers of Covered want in return are bug reports and user 
      input. Isn't the open source life grand?!</P>
