Basically, for each expression that was found to not be fully covered (either the expression itself or some sub-expression in the tree was not fully covered), the expression is output with various sub-expressions underlined and identified with a number. Each expression is also supplied with the line number that the expression started at in its module file. In our example, there is one expression in the module called "main" (see lines <a href="example.rptM.html#74">74 through 77</a> and one expression in the module called "foobar" (see lines <a href="example.rptM.html#112">112 through 113</a>.</P>

The letter 'E' above each possible value indicates that this subexpression is a unary expression (its value comes from one variable) and 'E' represents this subexpression's value (not the value of its subexpressions).</P>
