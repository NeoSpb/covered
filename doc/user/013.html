      Before you are ready to being scoring, merging and generating coverage reports from
      the design, you will first need to decide whether you want to post-process
      VCD/LXT -formatted dumpfiles generated from simulation or whether you want to 
      accummulate coverage information alongside the simulator using the simulator's VPI
      interface.  There are advantages and disadvantages to either method, so select
      the method that will best work for you.

      Generating coverage information from VCD/LXT -formatted dumpfiles requires three
      steps:  (1) compile the simulator to dump in the specified format, (2) run the
      simulation, (3) run Covered's score command using the dumpfile as input along with
      the design.  Performing these steps will generate the needed CDD file that can
      be used for merging or reporting.  The advantages to this approach is that
      the steps are fairly simple and are compiler/simulator -independent.  However, 
      there are two main drawbacks.  First, compiling with dumping enabled often slows
      simulation by some significant factor.  Second, the dumpfiles generated from
      simulation can often be quite large (especially for VCD dumping), consuming a lot
      of disk space.  Additionally, if your simulator dumps in a format different from
      VCD or LXT, you will need to perform an additional step in transforming the
      original dumpfile into one of these formats.  This is often a time-consuming task
      if the design and/or dumpfile is significantly large.  If you are generating lots
      of dumpfiles for coverage (say from running a regression), the amount of disk
      space needed to store these files can be tremendous, making this approach almost
      not feasible.</P>

      Generating coverage information using the VPI interface of the simulator requires
      three main steps:  (1) create a base CDD file from the design along with a top-level
      Verilog module and PLI table file (this second file is needed for the 
      commercial VCS compiler), (2) compile the simulator using the Covered VPI module
      (or shared object), (3) run the simulation.  The end result of these steps is the
      same CDD file that results from using the dumpfile method described above.  The
      primary advantage of this approach is that no dumpfiles are required, saving on
      disk space and dumpfile processing time.  The drawbacks of this approach are the
      following:  (1) simulation runs much slower using the VPI and Covered (most likely
      slower than creating dumpfiles from the simulator), (2) Covered VPI modules are
      only available for certain compilers (Icarus Verilog, Cver and VCS currently);
      however, adding support for other compilers should not be a difficult thing to do,
      (3) the VPI modules will only work for compilers that support the VPI interface
      (a Verilog-2001 feature).

      Before Covered can be invoked for dumpfile scoring, you must have a simulatable 
      Verilog design and a VCD or LXT dumpfile containing information from a simulation 
      run of the design that dumps the module(s) that you want to check for coverage. 
      The VCD dumpfile style was chosen due to its universal support by Verilog 
      simulators while the LXT dumpfile style was chosen due to its compactness and 
      growing support by other open source simulators and dumpfile readers.  Once you

      dump foo and the level of submodules just beneath it, you would set the dump 
      level to 2 and so on. To dump a module and all submodules beneath it, set the

      An LXT dumpfile can be created in several different ways depending on the
      Verilog simulation tool that you are using.  If you are using the

      open source simulator, you can simply generate an LXT-style dumpfile by specifying
      the -lxt2 option to the simulator command-line.  For example, if you had a file
      called "foo.v" that contained the same $dumpfile and $dumpvars commands used for
      VCD dumping and compiled it with Icarus Verilog into a VVP file called "a.out",
      you could cause Icarus Verilog to generate an LXT dumpfile (instead of a VCD
      dumpfile by calling "vvp a.out -lxt2".  This will cause an LXT style dumpfile
