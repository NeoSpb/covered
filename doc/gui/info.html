<h1>Introduction</h1>
The Covered report viewer GUI allows a user to view the coverage results from one or more CDD (Covered Design Database) files that have been previously generated using the Covered score and/or merge commands.  The advantages of using the GUI versus using an ASCII file to view coverage results are the following:

<ol>
	<li>View code that is covered/uncovered within the actual source file text (more context)</li>
	<li>Quickly see which modules/instances were uncovered for each coverage metric.</li>
	<li>Ability to hide/unhide verbose information for uncovered code.</li>
	<li>Quickly find expressions that caused combinational logic cases to be uncovered.</li>
	<li>Allows user to focus on a particular expression/signal/module/instance that is uncovered.</li>
</ol>
