<p>
The file menu is used to open a new CDD file, merge a related CDD file (derived from 
the same design as the currently opened CDD file, save the currently opened CDD 
file(s), close all opened CDD files, generate different types of output and view
the names of all currently opened CDD files.  Additionally, the user selects this menu 
bar to exit the Covered report viewer GUI.  Figure 1 shows the file menu contents 
within the main window.

<ul>
	<li><b>Open/Merge CDDs...</b>
	   <p>
	   This menu option is used to either open a new CDD file or merge a related CDD
	   file into the currently opened CDD file(s).  This action needs to be performed
	   before any coverage viewing can take place.  When this option is selected, a 
	   standard file window is displayed allowing the user to select one (or possibly
	   more depending on your version of Tcl/Tk) CDD file to open or merge (see Figure 
	   2).  To select more than one CDD file with one call to this option, simply press
	   and hold the Control key while selecting files with the left mouse button.  If
	   your version of Tcl/Tk supports this feature, you will see multiple files
	   highlighted for selection; otherwise, only the last selected file will be
	   selected.  If no CDD files currently are opened, any CDD file may be opened.  If 
	   one or more CDD files have been opened/merged, only CDD files generated from the
	   same design may be merged.</p>
	   <p>
		Note that this option has an accelerator keystroke &lt;Control-o&gt;.  Hitting
		this keystroke combination will also open new CDD file(s).</p>

   <li><b>View Loaded CDD(s)...</b>
      <p>
      This menu option is only available after an initial CDD file has been opened 
      using the "Open/Merge CDDs..." file menu option.  When this menu option is 
      selected, a new window displaying all currently opened CDD files is displayed
      (see Figure 3 below).  If another CDD file is merged and this window is currently 
      displayed, it is automatically updated with the newly added file.  If the "Close 
      CDDs..." file menu option is selected while this window is opened, all filenames 
      will be automatically removed to indicate this.  The "View Loaded CDD(s)..." menu 
      option is useful for helping the user see exactly which files have been merged 
      or not merged in the current viewer.  Simply click on the close button in the 
      "Loaded CDD file viewer" window to close the window.</p>

	<li><b>Save CDD...</b>
		<p>
		This menu option is only available after one or more CDD files have been
		opened/merged.  It is used to save the opened or merged CDD files as a single,
		merged CDD file than can be viewed as a separate CDD file or can be merged with
		other CDD files.  It is also used to save any changes that the user has made
		to exclude/include coverage cases within the GUI.  If you would like to retain
		this information, please save the CDD file.  By default, the name of the first
		loaded CDD file is placed in the "Save As" window when this option is selected.
		The user may choose to replace the old CDD file with the new one, or the user
		may save it under a different name.  Once a CDD file has been saved, this option
		is deselected until either a new CDD file is merged or the user changes the
		exclude/include property of any coverage case within the GUI.</p>
		<p>
		Note that this option has an accelerator keystroke &lt;Control-s&gt;.  Hitting
		this keystroke combination will also save the current CDD.</p></li>
		
	<li><b>Close CDDs</b>
		<p>
		This menu option is used to close all opened/merged CDD files so that the user
		may view a different CDD file without needing to exit and re-enter the GUI.
		The user may open and close as many times as needed without needing to reinvoke
		the GUI.  When CDD files are closed, any opened coverage windows are automatically
		closed and all necessary GUI components are restored to their original state as
		when the GUI is first invoked.  If the currently opened CDD file(s) have not been
		saved, a window (shown in Figure 4 below) is displayed to ask the user if they
		would like to save prior to closing.  To save the CDD file, simply click "Yes"
		and a "Save As" window will prompt you for a location/name to save it as.  To
		close the CDD file without saving, simply click "No".  To cancel the close
		operation, simply click "Cancel".  To view another CDD file after closing all
		CDD files, simply select the "Open/Merge CDDs..." file menu option.</p>
		<p>
		Note that this option has an accelerator keystroke &lt;Control-w&gt;.  Hitting
		this keystroke combination will also close all opened CDD files.</p>

	<li><b>Generate</b>
		<p>
		This option, when selected, displays a submenu of items that can be generated
		by the GUI.  The following options (with descriptions) are available (see
		Figure 5).</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>ASCII Report...</b></li>
				<p>
				Selecting this submenu option will cause Covered to generate an ASCII
				version of the coverage report to a specified file (note:  this can also
				be accomplished with the "report" command of Covered's command-line
				interface).  When this option is selected, another window is created 
				that lists the current report generation options as specified in the 
				Preferences window.  Additionally, the user may modify the report generation
				options and select the name of the coverage report file to save.  See 
				<a href="report_gen.html">ASCII Report Generation Window</a> for more
				information on the navigation of this window.</p>
				<p>
				Note that this option has an accelerator keystroke &lt;Control-r&gt;.
				Hitting this keystrokey combination will also cause the ASCII
				report generator window to be displayed.</p></li>
		</ul>

	<li><b>Exit</b>
		<p>
		This menu option will exit the entire GUI application, closing all opened windows 
		created by this application.  Use this option to exit the application.  If
		the currently opened CDD file(s) have not been saved, a window (shown in Figure
		6 below) is displayed to ask the user if they would like to save prior to
		exiting.  To save the CDD file, simply click "Yes" and a "Save As" window will
		prompt you for a location/name to save it as.  To close the CDD file without
		saving, simply click "No".  To cancel the close operation, simply click "Cancel".
		</p>
		<p>
		Note that this option has an accelerator keystroke &lt;Control-x&gt;.  Hitting
		this keystroke combination will also close the entire application.</p>
