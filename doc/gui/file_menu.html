<p>
The file menu is used to open a new CDD file, open a related CDD file (derived from the 
same design as the currently opened CDD file, or merge a related CDD file with the 
contents of the currently opened CDD file.  Additionally, the user selects this menu 
bar to exit the Covered report viewer GUI.  Figure 1 shows the file menu contents 
within the main window.

<ul>
	<li><b>Open Initial CDD...</b>
	   <p>
	   This menu option is only available when the GUI is first invoked and a CDD file has 
	   not been previously loaded.  Use this option to load an initial CDD file into the GUI 
	   for analyzing a design.  When this option is selected, a standard file window is 
	   displayed allowing the user to select a CDD file to open (see Figure 2).  At this 
	   point, any CDD file from any design can be opened.</p></li>
	
	<li><b>Open Related CDD...</b>
		<p>
		This menu option is only available after a previous CDD file has been opened by 
		the GUI using the "Open Initial CDD..." file menu option.  By selecting this menu 
		option, the user is able to open a different CDD file that was generated from the 
		same design as the CDD file originally opened by the tool.  Since Covered's GUI 
		does not currently have a close CDD file option, it is important to make sure that 
		the CDD file selected with this option is from the exact same design as the 
		previously opened CDD file.  Failing to do so will currently cause undetermined 
		errors to occur.  The CDD file selected by this option will replace the currently 
		opened CDD file information (i.e., the results from the previously opened CDD file 
		will not be merged with the results from the new CDD file -- to do this see the 
		"Merge Related CDD..." option).  Figure 2. shows the open CDD file viewer that is 
		invoked when this option is selected.</p></li>
	
	<li><b>Merge Related CDD...</b>
		<p>
		This menu option is only available after a previous CDD file has been opened by the 
		GUI using the "Open Initial CDD..." file menu option.  By selecting this menu 
		option, the user is able to merge the results of the currently opened CDD file 
		with the CDD file selected (from the design) and view these merged results in the 
		rest of the viewer.  The merged results are NOT written to any new files (unlike 
		the behavior of Covered's "merge" command) so when the GUI exits, the merged 
		results are thrown away.</p>
		<p>
		Note that it is possible to merge several CDD files, generated from the same 
		design, together by using this menu option more than once.  The results of the 
		previously opened/merged CDD files will be merged with the results from the CDD 
		file that is selected by this option.</p></li>
	
        <li><b>View Loaded CDD(s)...</b>
                <p>
                This menu option is only available after an initial CDD file has been opened using
                the "Open Initial CDD..." file menu option.  When this menu option is selected,
                a new window displaying all currently opened CDD files is displayed.  If another
                CDD file is merged using the "Merge Related CDD..." file menu option and this window
                is currently displayed, it is automatically updated with the newly added file.  If
                the "Open Related CDD..." file menu option is selected while this window is opened,
                the new filename will replace all filenames in this window.  The "View Loaded CDD(s)..."
                menu option is useful for helping the user see exactly which files have been merged
                or not merged in the current viewer.  Simply click on the close button in the
                "Loaded CDD file viewer" window to close the window.</p></li>

	<li><b>Exit</b>
		<p>
		This menu option will exit the entire GUI application, closing all opened windows 
		created by this application.  Use this option to exit the application.</p>
		<p>
		Note that this option has an accelerator keystroke &lt;Control-x&gt;.  Hitting
		this keystroke combination will also close the entire application.</p></li>
