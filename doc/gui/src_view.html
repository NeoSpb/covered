<p>
The Assertion Source Viewer window allows the user to see the source code for the current
assertion in the <a href="assert.html">Verbose Assertion Coverage window</a>.  To view
this window, simply click the <b>Show Code</b> button in the Verbose Assertion Coverage
window.  Figure 1 shows a zero_one_hot OVL assertion code with syntax highlighting applied.

<h2>Navigating the Source Code</h2>

<p>
The source code for the current assertion will be automatically displayed in the text
viewer when the window is created.  However, the source code will be displayed as it is
found in the file system, without preprocessing applied to it.  This means that included
files will not be displayed in an in-lined fashion.  To view included files, simply click
on the included filename (it will be underlined).  This will cause the included file to
replace its includer in the text viewer.  An infinite number of includes may be traversed
in this manner.  To go back to the file that included the current file, simply click on
the <b>Back</b> button located in the bottom left-hand corner of the window.  This will
cause the current source code to be replaced with its "parent" source code.
</p>

<p>
Note that the <b>Back</b> button will be disabled when the top-level assertion file is
currently displayed.
</p>

<h2>Close Button</h2>

Clicking the <b>Close</b> button will cause only this window to be closed.
</p>

<h2>Help Button</h2>

<p>
Clicking the <b>Help</b> button will cause this help page to be displayed in a web
brower.
