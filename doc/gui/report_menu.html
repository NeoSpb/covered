<p>The report menu allows the user to display the currently opened CDD file contents in a number of different ways for analyzing.  The options specified in this menu closely imitate the options in the "score" command.  The type of report can be changed at any point in time while a CDD is loaded.  When a report menu option is selected, Covered will automatically convert all information in the GUI to represent this report type.  Figure 1. below shows the contents of the report menu.  Each menu item is described below the figure.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Module-Based</b>
		<p>
		When the diamond to the left of this option is selected, the generated report 
		information will be in module-based representation.  A module-based report 
		gathers all of the module instances that instantiate the same module and merges 
		their results based on the module name.  This is useful for understanding what 
		logic in a module has been tested or untested without care to individual 
		instance contribution.  Selecting this report type (the default) will cause 
		the "Instance-based" menu option to be automatically deselected (the two report 
		types are mutually exclusive).</p></li>
	<li><b>Instance-Based</b>
		<p>
		When the diamond to the left of this option is selected, the generated report 
		information will be in instance-based representation.  An instance-based report 
		shows the coverage information for each module instance within the design.  This 
		allows the user to discern what logic is being covered in individual instances.  
		Selecting this report type will cause the "Module-based" menu option to be 
		automatically deselected (the two report types are mutually exclusive).</p></li>
	<li><b>Show Uncovered</b>
		<p>
		When the square to the left of this option is selected (the default), all 
		uncovered lines, toggles, logic, and FSM states/arcs within the file viewer 
		window will be highlighted for the user to quickly see what code was monitored 
		by Covered but determined to not be fully covered.  This option may be selected 
		along with the "Show Covered" menu option to see both covered and uncovered 
		logic within the same file.</p></li>
	<li><b>Show Covered</b>
		<p>
		When the square to the left of this option is selected, all covered lines, 
		toggles, logic, and FSM states/arcs within the file viewer window will be 
		highlighted for the user to quickly see what code was monitored by Covered 
		and determined to be fully covered.  This option is useful for the user of 
		Covered to understand what logic was monitored during simulation.  This option 
		may be selected along with the "Show Uncovered" menu option to see both 
		covered and uncovered logic within the same file.</p></li>
	<li><b>Show Race Conditions</b>
		<p>
		When the square to the left of this option is selected, all logic lines that 
		were found to contain a potential race condition and was, therefore, eliminated 
		from coverage consideration by Covered will be highlighted by the colors as 
		selected in the preference menu.  This option is useful for the user of Covered 
		to understand what logic was not considered for coverage information due to a 
		detected potential race condition situation.  Please see the User's Guide for 
		more information on what Covered looks for in logic to consider it to be a 
		possible race condition.</p></li>
