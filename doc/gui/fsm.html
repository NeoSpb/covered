<h1>Navigating the FSM State/State Transition Coverage Window</h1>
<hr>

<p>
The Verbose FSM State/State Transition Coverage window allows the user to see which
states and state transitions of a currently selected FSM have been covered or are
uncovered.  To view this window, simply select the "FSM" coverage metric mode in the
<a href="cov_bar.html">Coverage Metric Bar</a> in the main window and select an
underlined FSM state variable in the <a href="cov_view.html">Coverage File Viewer</a>.
This will cause the FSM Coverage window to be displayed with the currently selected
FSM information loaded.  Figure 1 below shows an example of this window.

<h2>Navigating the Window</h2>

<p>
The Verbose FSM window is split into two main frames.  The top frame contains the
expressions that make up the input and output states of the selected FSM.  The bottom
frame contains a two-dimensional table showing the covered and/or uncovered states and
state transitions.
</p>

<p>
The state/state transition table is a two-dimensional table with all possible values of the
input states in the left-most column, the output states in the upper-most row, and
the state transitions in the rest of the table.
</p>

<p>
To determine which states have been uncovered in the table, simply find all state values
in the input column or output row (both show the same information) which are highlighted 
with the "Uncovered" color selection specified in the
<a href="preferences.html">Preferences window</a>.  To determine which states have been
covered in the table, simply find all state values in the input column or output row which
are highlighted with the "Covered" color selection.  All other state values which are
not highlighted are either impossible values (if all of the state transitions were
specified in the Verilog file) or are unknown for coverage (if not all of the state
transitions were specified in the Verilog file).
</p>

<p>
To determine which state transitions have been uncovered in the table, simply find all
empty boxes in the table that are highlighted with the "Uncovered" background color.  If
one of these exist, it specifies that the transition of "input state" (the value
specified in the left-most column in the same row) to "output state" (the value specified
in the upper-most row in the same column) did not occur.  In the example above, we can
see that the following state transitions did not occur:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>1 -> 2</li>
  <li>3 -> 1</li>
  <li>2 -> 3</li>
  <li>2 -> 2 (loopback case)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Follow the same procedure for finding all covered state transitions in the table except
that these boxes will be highlighted with the "Covered" background color.  In the example
above, we can see that the following state transitions occurred:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>0 -> 0 (loopback case)</li>
  <li>0 -> 1</li>
  <li>1 -> 3</li>
  <li>3 -> 0</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
All other state transition boxes that are not highlighted are either impossible state
transitions (if all state transitions were specified in the Verilog source code) or
are unknown in their coverage (either not hit or impossible transition if all state
transitions were not specified in the Verilog source code).
</p>

<h2>Displaying a New FSM</h2>

<p>
If the Verbose FSM Coverage window is currently displayed, the user may select a 
new FSM state variable in the <a href="cov_view.html">Coverage File Viewer</a> of the Main
window.  When a new FSM is selected, its information immediately replaces the 
currently selected FSM.  This feature allows many different FSMs to be viewed 
one after the other without having to create/destroy a new window for each.
</p>

<p>
The user may also see the previous or next uncovered FSM in the main viewer by 
clicking either the "<--" button (for previous signal viewing) or the "-->" button 
(for next signal viewing).  Note that the "<--" button will be disabled if there is 
not a signal previous to the current signal in the given module and the "-->" button 
will be disabled if there is not a signal after the current signal in the given module.
</p>

<h2>Close Button</h2>

<p>
Clicking the <b>Close</b> button will cause the Verbose FSM Coverage window
to close and the current selection identifier to be removed from the Coverage Viewer
in the main window.
</p>

<h2>Help Button</h2>

<p>
Clicking the <b>Help</b> button will cause this help page to be displayed in a web
brower.
