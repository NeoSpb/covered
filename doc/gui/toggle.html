<h1>Navigating the Toggle Coverage Window</h1>
<hr>

<p>
The verbose toggle window allows the user to see which bits for a given signal have
toggled from a 0->1 or a 1->0 during simulation.  Figure 1 shows a 4-bit signal called
"value1" in which bit 0 has successfully toggled from a 0->1.

<h2>Understanding the Layout</h2>

<p>
The bit vector displayed is a binary bit vector, each value (0 or 1) represents whether
that bit in the signal either toggled (1) or did not toggle (0) during simulation.  There
are two bit vectors displayed for the signal, the top vector shows the 0->1 toggle
information while the bottom vector shows the 1->0 toggle information.
</p>

<p>
The name of the signal along with its MSB:LSB information is displayed at the bottom
of the window; however, if the mouse cursor is placed over a specific bit in the toggle
box, the MSB:LSB will be changed to show the displayed bit, making it easy for the user
to discern exactly which bit has toggled/not toggled.  If the width of the signal
exceeds the given space for the toggle window, a scrollbar will be allowed to slide
left and right to view the rest of the toggle information.  
</p>

<p>
To exit this window, simply click on the window manager X button in the upper right-hand
corner of the window.
</p>

<h2>Displaying a New Signal</h2>

<p>
If the Verbose Toggle Coverage window is currently displayed with a signal, the user may
select a new signal in the <a href="cov_view.html">Coverage File Viewer</a> of the Main
window.  When a new signal is selected, its value immediately replaces the currently
selecting signal value.  This feature allows many different signals to be viewed one
after the other without having to create/destroy a new window for each signal.
