<h2>Set Acceptable Coverage Goals Frame</h2>

<p>
This frame contains four spinner boxes that contains values between 0 and 100.  These
values correspond to a coverage percentage for each coverage metric that the user
deems to be "good enough".  These values are used by the 
<a href="summary.html">Summary Window</a> to help visually identify modules/instances
that are meeting or exceeding these goals and which modules are not meeting these goals.
If a coverage percentage for a module/instance is less than this value, the module 
is colored red.  If the coverage percentage is greater than or equal to this value,
the module/instance is colored yellow (or green which indicates that the module/instance
reached 100% coverage for a given metric). 
</p>

<p>
To increase the specified percentage value, simply click on the 
<img src="images/up_button.png" alt="Up Button"> to the right of the percentage until
the desired value is displayed.  To decrease the specified percentage value, simply 
click on the <img src="images/dn_button.png" alt="Down Button"> to the right of the
percentage until the desired value is displayed.
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Line Coverage %</strong></li>
    <p>
    Sets the coverage goal of line coverage to the specified percentage to the

    <li><strong>Toggle Coverage %</strong></li>
    <p>
    Sets the coverage goal of toggle coverage to the specified percentage to

    <li><strong>Combinational Logic Coverage %</strong></li>
    <p>
    Sets the coverage goal of combinational coverage to the specified percentage
    to the right.  If combinational logic coverage for a given module/instance meets

    window.</p>
    <li><strong>FSM State/Arc Coverage %</strong></li>
    <p>

    window.</p>
    <li><strong>Assertion Coverage %</strong></li>
    <p>
