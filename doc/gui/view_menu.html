<ul>
	<li><b>Summary...</b>
		<p>
		Displays the <a href="summary.html">Summary Window</a> if this window does not
		exist or forces it to the foreground if it currently does.</p></li>
		
	<li><b>Next Uncovered</b>
		<p>
		Causes the line containing the next uncovered metric to be visible in the
		<a href="cov_view.html">Coverage Viewer</a>.  If the next uncovered line is
		already visible, this menu item will have no visible effect.  The search for the
		next uncovered line starts at (a) the top of the module (when the module is first
		displayed in the the Coverage Viewer), (b) from the last uncovered line searched
		for with the "Next Uncovered" or "Previous Uncovered" calls, or (c) from the
		last currently selected line (only valid for toggle and combinational logic 
		views).</p>
		<p>
		This menu item is only enabled when another uncovered line exists after the
		current uncovered line.  It can also be accessed with the accelerator keystroke
		&lt;Control-n&gt; or the "-->" button in the Main Window.</p></li>
		
	<li><b>Previous Uncovered</b>
		<p>
		Causes the line containing the previous uncovered metric to be visible in the
		<a href="cov_view.html">Coverage Viewer</a>.  If the previous uncovered line is
		already visible, this menu item will have no visible effect.  The search for the
		previous uncovered line starts at (a) the top of the module (when the module is 
		first displayed in the the Coverage Viewer), (b) from the last uncovered line 
		searched for with the "Next Uncovered" or "Previous Uncovered" calls, or (c) from 
		the last currently selected line (only valid for toggle and combinational logic 
		views).
		</p>
		<p>
		This menu item is only enabled when another uncovered line exists before the
		current uncovered line.  It can also be accessed with the accelerator keystroke
		&lt;Control-p&gt; or the "<--" button in the Main Window.
		</p></li>
		
	<li><b>Show Current Selection</b>
		<p>
		This menu item is only available if the current metric mode is not "Line", the 
		user has clicked on an uncovered segment of code, and the associated
		<a href="toggle.html">Verbose Toggle Window</a>,
		<a href="comb.html">Verbose Combinational Logic Window</a>,
		<a href="fsm.html">Verbose FSM State/State Transition Window</a> or
		<a href="assert.html">Verbose Assertion Coverage Window</a> exists.  The currently
		selected line is visually identified in the <a href="cov_view.html">Coverage
		Viewer</a> area on the left-hand-side of the line containing the uncovered code.
		If this line is not currently visible in the Coverage Viewer, selecting this menu
		item will cause it to be visible.</p>
		<p>
		An accelerator keystroke &lt;Control-c&gt; will also invoke this menu item.</p></li>
		
	<li><b>Preferences...</b>
		<p>
		Causes the <a href="preferences.html">Preferences Window</a> to be created if it
		currently does not exist or forces it into the foreground if it does exist.</p>
