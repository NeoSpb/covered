<p>
The Summary Report window allows the user to at-a-glance see how well each of the modules
or instances is achieving coverage for a given coverage metric.  The modules/instances
are ordered according to percentage of coverage for the current metric.  They are also
highlighted in red, yellow and green to indicate the level of coverage achievement each
module/instance has made for the current coverage metric.
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <font color="red">Red</font> - Indicates that the module/instance had a coverage
      percentage between 0 and the user-specified coverage goal that was selected in the
      <a href="preferences.html">Preferences</a> window.  This indicates that the
      module/instance failed to reach an adequate coverage percentage.</li>
    <li>
      <font color="yellow">Yellow</font> - Indicates that the module/instance had a
      coverage percentage between the user-specified coverage goal that was
      selected in the <a href="preferences.html">Preferences</a> window and 99%
      coverage.  This indicates that the module/instance reached adequate coverage
      percentage but is not 100% covered.</li>
    <li>
      <font color="green">Green</font> - Indicates that the module/instance had a coverage
      percentage of 100%.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
Figure 1. shows an example of a summary report based on module-line coverage.  The
user-specified <strong>Line Coverage %</strong> goal was set to 80%.

<h2>Selecting a Summary Report</h2>

<p>
The contents of the Summary Report window are selected by the current mode in the
<a href="main.html">Main Window</a>.  To view the summary report by module, select
the <strong>Report > Module-Based</strong> option.  If the Summary Report window
is already displayed, selecting this option will automatically cause the Summary
Report information to be displayed by module.  Likewise, to view the summary report by
instance, select the <strong>Report > Instance-Based</strong> option.
</p>

<p>
To view a summary report based on different the coverage metrics, simply select 
one of the buttons in the main window.  Doing so will automatically cause all 
percentages to be redisplayed for the new coverage metric and will automatically 
cause these modules/instances to be re-ordered based on the new percentages.
</p>

<h2>Viewing a Detailed Report from the Summary Report Window</h2>

<p>
To view the coverage details for a specific module/instance back in the main window,
simply click on the name of the module/instance in the summary window.  The main
window will jump to the selected module/instance, displaying/highlighting the
code for that module in the <a href="cov_view.html">Coverage File Viewer</a>.
</p>

<h2>Ordering By Percentages</h2>

<p>
By default, all modules/instances are displayed in the Summary Report window in 
decreasing order by coverage percentage.  The user may change this ordering to
increasing order (the lowest percentage will be displayed at the top of the window),
by selecting the "Increasing Order" button.  The user may switch back to decreasing
ordered display by selecting the "Decreasing Order" button.
</p>
