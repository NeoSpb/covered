<h1>Navigating the Line Coverage Window</h1>
<hr>

<p>
Line coverage is the quickest way to determine what logic in your design is being 
exercised and which logic has not be exercised during simulation.  If a line was found 
to not be simulated, this is an indication that there was some event that did not occur 
or did not occur at the proper time to cause a previous conditional expression to be 
evaluated to true or false.  For example, if a block of code looked something like:
</p>

<table align="center" border="0">
  <tr><th align="left">Line</th><th align="left">Logic</th></tr>
  <tr><td>1</td><td><code>always @(posedge clock)</code></td></tr>
  <tr><td>2</td><td><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;if( a )</code></td></tr>
  <tr><td>3</td><td><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b <= 1'b0;</code></td></tr>
  <tr><td>4</td><td><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;else</code></td></tr>
  <tr><td>5</td><td><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b <= 1'b1;</code></td></tr>
</table>

<p>
If line 3 was shown to be not covered, this would indicate that at the positive edge 
of the term "clock", the value of "a" never evaluated to a value of 1 (true).  To make 
line 3 become covered, we would need to setup a situation in the diagnostic that 
caused "a" to become true at the positive edge of the term "clock".
</p>

<p>On the other hand, if all lines 2 - 5 were found to be uncovered, this would indicate 
the the term "clock" never made a transition from some value to a 1 (true) value 
during simulation.
</p>

<h3>Viewing Uncovered Lines</h3>

<p>
To view line coverage for all uncovered lines for a specific module/instance, do the 
following:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Make sure that the "Show Uncovered" menu item in the <a href="report_menu.html">Report menu</a> is selected.</li>
	<li>Select the line coverage metric in the <a href="cov_bar.html">Coverage Type Bar</a> by left-clicking on selection button to the left of "Line".</li>
	<li>Select one of the modules/instances that is highlighted in the uncovered color scheme (to change this color scheme, see <a href="pref_menu.html">Preferences Menu</a>) in the <a href="mod_inst_lb.html">Module/Instance Listbox</a>.  This will cause the selected module/instance source code to be displayed in the <a href="cov_view.html">Coverage File Viewer</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Once the selected module/instance has been displayed, scroll down in the Coverage File 
Viewer window (using the scroll bars to the right and below the Coverage File Viewer 
window) until you have reached a line that is highlighted in the uncovered color scheme.  
The line number of the highlighted line will be printed to the left of the source code 
line.  This line represents a line that was found to not be hit during the simulation 
of this module/instance.
</p>

<h4>Excluding/Included Uncovered Lines from Line Coverage</h4>

<p>
Any uncovered line in the design may be included/excluded from coverage consideration.  To the left of
each uncovered line is an underlined <u>I</u> (line is included in coverage) or <u>E</u> (line is excluded in coverage).
Clicking on this character will change the coverage exclusion property of the line by recalculating the
summary line coverage information, redisplaying it in the <a href="summary_bar.html">Main Window Summary Bar</a>,
changing the background color of the line from the uncovered background color to the covered background color, and
changing the leftmost character of the line to the opposite value to indicate its current status.  Figure 1 shows
an uncovered line that is included for coverage consideration.  Figure 2 shows the same line which is now excluded
from coverage consideration.
</p>

<div align="center">
   <p><b>Figure 1.  Example of uncovered line included for line coverage consideration</b></p>
   <img src="images/line_incl.png" alt="Uncovered, included line">
</div>

<div align="center">
   <p><b>Figure 2.  Example of uncovered line excluded for line coverage consideration</b></p>
   <img src="images/line_excl.png" alt="Uncovered, excluded line">
</div>

<p>
In addition to changing the line coverage information, the combinational logic coverage information for an uncovered
statement on that line will also be implicitly excluded from coverage (though the exclude properties for each subexpression
of the statement will not change).
</p>

<p>
If the user excludes any line in the design, the "Save CDD..." option in the
<a href="file_menu.html">File Menu</a> will be enabled.  This allows the user to save the excluded property
either back to the CDD file (or to a newly named CDD file).  Doing so will allow the user to load the
CDD file at a different time and retain the knowledge of which lines have been excluded/included
for coverage.  Additionally, if a saved CDD file with coverage exclusion is merged with another CDD file,
the excluded line information is preserved for the resulting merged CDD file.
</p>

<h3>Viewing Covered Lines</h3>

<p>
To view line coverage for all covered lines for a specific module/instance, do the 
following:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Make sure that the "Show Covered" menu item in the <a href="report_menu.html">Report menu</a> is selected.</li>
	<li>Select the line coverage metric in the <a href="cov_bar.html">Coverage Type Bar</a> by left-clicking on the selection button to the left of "Line".</li>
	<li>Select one of the modules/instances in the <a href="mod_inst_lb.html">Module/Instance Listbox</a> that shows that at least one line was considered coverable by Covered by looking in the <a href="summary_bar.html">Coverage Summary Bar</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Once the selected module/instance has been displayed, scroll down in the Coverage File 
Viewer window (using the scroll bars to the right and below the Coverage File Viewer 
window) until you have reached a line that is highlighted in the covered color scheme.  
The line number of the highlighted line will be printed to the left of the source code 
line.  This line represents a line that was found to be hit during the simulation of 
this module/instance.
</p>

<h3>Important Note</h3>

<p>
You may see both the covered and uncovered line coverage simultaneously by selecting 
both the "Show Uncovered" and "Show Covered" items in the Report menu.  This is sometimes 
useful to see what logic Covered was not able to provide coverage support for (all 
lines which contain code that are not highlighted in either the uncovered or covered 
color schemes).
