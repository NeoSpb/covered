<h1>Navigating the Assertion Coverage Window</h1>
<hr>

<p>
The Verbose Assertion Coverage window allows the user to see exactly which coverage points
were hit or missed for a selected assertion instantiation in the design and, if hit, how
many times the assertion coverage point (ACP) was hit during simulation.  Additionally, this
window allows you to bring up the <a href="src_view.html">Assertion Source File Viewer</a>
to view the internal assertion module code for the currently selected assertion instance.
This lets the user view the code to determine what logically needs to occur to hit a
given ACP.
</p>

<p>
To view this window, select the "Assert" mode in the <a href="cov_bar.html">Coverage
Selection Bar</a> in the main window and click on an underlined assertion instance name in 
the <a href="cov_view.html">File Viewer</a>.  Note that both covered and uncovered
assertion instance names can be selected.  Doing so will cause the Verbose Assertion
Coverage Window to be displayed for the selected assertion instantiation.  Figure 1 shows
an example of a zero_one_hot assertion that had none of its coverage points hit during
simulation.

<h2>Navigating the Assertion Coverage Window</h2>

<p>
The window is made up of a simple table which contains the coverage point names within
the selected assertion on the left and the number of times each of these coverage points
were hit during simulation on the right.  If a coverage point has not been hit, both the
coverage point name and the number of hits (0) will be highlighted with the "uncovered"
color selection as selected in the <a href="preferences.html">Preferences window</a>.  If
a coverage point has been hit at least once, both the coverage point name and the number
of hits will be highlighted with the "covered" color selection as selected in the
Preferences window.
</p>

<p>
Below the table the name of the currently selected assertion type is named.  To view the
source code for this assertion, simply click on the <b>Show Code</b> button at the bottom
right-hand portion of the coverage table.  This will cause the source code for this
assertion to be displayed in a new <a href="src_view.html">Assertion Source Viewer 
window</a>.
</p>

<h2>Displaying a New Assertion Instance</h2>

<p>
If the Verbose Assertion Coverage window is currently displayed, the user may select a 
new assertion in the <a href="cov_view.html">Coverage File Viewer</a> of the Main
window.  When a new assertion is selected, its information immediately replaces the 
currently selected assertion.  This feature allows many different assertions to be viewed 
one after the other without having to create/destroy a new window for each.
</p>

<p>
The user may also see the previous or next uncovered assertion in the main viewer by 
clicking either the "<--" button (for previous signal viewing) or the "-->" button 
(for next signal viewing).  Note that the "<--" button will be disabled if there is 
not a signal previous to the current signal in the given module and the "-->" button 
will be disabled if there is not a signal after the current signal in the given module.
</p>

<h2>Close Button</h2>

<p>
Clicking the <b>Close</b> button will cause the Verbose Assertion Coverage window (and
the <a href="src_view.html">Assertion Source Viewer window</a> if it is currently displayed)
to close and the current selection identifier to be removed from the Coverage Viewer
in the main window.
</p>

<h2>Help Button</h2>

<p>
Clicking the <b>Help</b> button will cause this help page to be displayed in a web
brower.
