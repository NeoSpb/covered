<h1>Navigating the ASCII Report Generator Window</h1>
<hr>

<p>
When the File->Generate->ASCII Report menu option is selected, the ASCII Report Generator Window
is created to allow the user to view the current report output options, edit those options, and
create a name for the report file.  Once the report has been generated, this window will automatically
close.  The resulting report file can be viewed with any text file viewer and is equivalent to a
report file generated with a "covered report ..." command-line call.  Figure 1 shows an example of 
this window.

<h2>Navigating the Window</h2>

<p>
The "Create ASCII report" window contains three frames which are described below.</p>

<h3>Selected ASCII Report Options Frame</h3>

<p>
The upper portion of the window shows the current options that will be passed to the report
generator.  These options can be modified in the <a href="pref_report.html">Preferences</a> window.
The window provides a short-cut way to get to the ASCII report option pane in the Preferences window
by simply clicking on the "Edit Options..." button in the upper right corner of this window.  The
various options to the report generator are the following:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Level of Detail</b>
		<p>
		This value indicates the amount of information that is output to the report file.  The
		possible values are:  'Summary', 'Detailed' or 'Verbose'.  Please see the Covered User's Guide
		for more information.</p></li>
	<li><b>Accumulated By</b>
		<p>
      This value indicats how the coverage information will be accumulated:  on a per module
      basis or on a per instance basis.  The possible values are:  'Module' or 'Instance'.  Please
      see the Covered User's Guide for more information.</p></li>
   <li><b>Show Metrics</b>
   	<p>
      This value indicates which coverage metrics will be reported in the ASCII report file.
      The possible values are: 'Line', 'Toggle', 'Logic', 'FSM', 'Assertion' and/or 'Race Conditions'.</p></li>
   <li><b>Coverage Type</b>
   	<p>
      This value indicates whether uncovered or covered coverage cases will be reported to the file.
      The possible values are: 'Uncovered' or 'Covered'.  Please see the Covered User's Guide
      for more information.</p></li>
   <li><b>Line Width</b>
   	<p>
   	This value indicates whether Verilog code output in the report file will be output in the
   	same manner as is found in the source code or if a user-specified line width (in characters)
   	should be used instead.  This option allows the user to make the report file more easily
   	readable.  The possible values are 'Preformatted' (to indicate that the line widths should
   	be preserved from the original source code) or 'X characters' where X indicates an integer
   	value greater than 0.  Please see the Covered User's Guide for more information.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Save To File Frame</h3>

<p>
The middle frame of the ASCII Report window allows the user to specify a filename/location for the
generated output file.  By default, the report name is the same as the first CDD file loaded, substituting
the .cdd extension for a .rpt extension.  By default, the directory location to store the generated
report is the same directory that the first CDD file exists in.  To change this name/location, the user
may either enter a value in the entry field or click on the 'Browse...' button to display a "Save As"
type window.
</p>

<h3>Bottom Button Frame</h3>

<p>
The button bar on the bottom of the window contains three buttons.  Clicking the 'Create' button will
generate a report file using the specified options and filename specified in the upper two frames of this
window.  After the report has been created, the window will automatically close and the generated file
can be viewed with any text viewer.  Clicking the 'Cancel' button will not generate a report and will
cause the window to close.  Clicking the 'Help' button will display this help page.
