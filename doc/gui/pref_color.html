<p>
The color preference pane allows the user to adjust the foreground and background
colors for all code that is considered covered, uncovered or in a race condition state.

<h2>Set Highlight Color</h2>

<p>
This frame contains six buttons that affect the foreground and background colors
used to highlight code in the <a href="cov_view.html">Coverage File Viewer</a> portion
of the main window.  The currently selected foreground/background colors are displayed
on the buttons themselves to allow the user to see the selections prior to committing
to them by clicking the <strong>Apply</strong> or <strong>OK</strong> buttons at the
bottom of the Preferences window.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Change Uncovered Foreground</strong>
	<p>
	Allows the user to specify the foreground color to use for logic that is not fully 
	covered in the logic window.  Figure 2. shows what the color selection window looks 
	like.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Change Uncovered Background</strong>
	<p>
	Allows the user to specify the background color to use for logic that is not fully 
	covered in the logic window.  To view highlighted text, this color value should not 
	be set to the same value as the "Uncovered Foreground" color.  Figure 2. shows what 
	the color selection window looks like.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Change Covered Foreground</strong>
	<p>
	Allows the user to specify the foreground color to use for logic that is fully covered 
	in the logic window.  Figure 2. shows what the color selection window looks like.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Change Covered Background</strong>
	<p>
	Allows the user to specify the background color to use for logic that is fully 
	covered in the logic window.  To view highlighted text, this color value should 
	not be set to the same value as the "Covered Foreground" color.  Additionally, to 
	help distinguish covered logic from uncovered logic (when both information is 
	viewed together), it is important that this color be different from the "Uncovered 
	Background" color.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Change Race Condition Foreground</strong>
	<p>
	Allows the user to specify the foreground color to use for logic that was found to 
	contain a potential race condition and was, therefore, eliminated from coverage 
	consideration by Covered.  Figure 2. shows what the color selection window looks 
	like.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Change Race Condition Background</strong><
	<p>
	Allows the user to specify the background color to use for logic that was found 
	to contain a potential race condition and was, therefore, eliminated from coverage 
	consideration by Covered.  To view highlighted text, this color value should not 
	be set to the same value as the "Race Condition Foreground" color.  Additionally, 
	to help distinguish this type of logic from covered and uncovered logic (when 
	either of these pieces of information are viewed together), it is important that 
	this color be different from the other background colors.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
To adjust the color, simply move the arrows beneath the red, green, and/or blue color 
spectrums until the desired combined color (distinguished in the window in the lower 
right-hand corner of the window) is displayed.  The user may also specify the 8-bit 
color value for red, green, and/or blue in the entry field to the left of each color 
spectrum.  Finally, the user may specify the 6-digit hexidecimal color value in the 
entry field on the right-hand side of the window.  Whenever the color is modified by 
using any of these controls, all of the other controls are changed to reflect the 
current color selected.</p>
