    <title>Usage</title>
    <para>
      The merge command is initiated with the following call:
    </para>
    <para>
      <code>covered merge [<emphasis>options</emphasis>] <emphasis>existing_CDD</emphasis> <emphasis>CDD_to_merge</emphasis>+</code>
    </para>
    <para>
      The <emphasis>existing_CDD</emphasis> specifier relates to any existing CDD. If the -o option is not specified (see 
      below for details), this file will be replaced with the merged CDD created by the merge. This is important to 
      remember since merging is an irreversible operation (apart from generating a brand-new CDD from the design and 
      dumpfile using the score command).
    </para>
    <para>
      The <emphasis>CDD_to_merge</emphasis> specifier relates to any existing CDD that is not the 
      <emphasis>existing_CDD</emphasis>. Though it is not illegal to merge the same CDD to itself, the result is the same 
      as the original CDD. Note that all files treated as <emphasis>CDD_to_merge</emphasis> are guaranteed not to be 
      modified by the merge command. These files are only read by Covered and then merged into the information contained 
      in the <emphasis>existing_CDD</emphasis>.

                Directory to search for CDD files to include.  This option is used in conjunction with the -ext option 
                which specifies the file extension to use for determining which files in the directory are CDD files.

                  Specifies how to handle exclusion reason resolution.  If two or more CDD files being merged have exclusion
                  reasons specified for the same coverage point, the exclusion reason needs to be resolved (unless it is the
                  same string value).  If this option is not specified and a conflict is found, Covered will interactively
                  request input for each exclusion as to how to handle it.  If this option is specified, it tells Covered
                  how to handle all exclusion reason conflicts.  The values are as follows:
