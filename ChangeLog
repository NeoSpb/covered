2006-10-19 14:04  phase1geo

	Removed pragma comment parsing from pplexer.l (this is handled by
	the normal parser).

2006-10-18 20:43  phase1geo

	Updating configuration files and documentation for new development
	release date.

2006-10-16 16:34  phase1geo

	Increased max bit width from 1024 to 65536 to allow for more room
	for memories.  Fixed issue with enumerated values being explicitly
	assigned unknown values and created error output message when an
	implicitly assigned enum followed an explicitly assign unknown enum
	value.	Fixed problem with generate blocks in different
	instantiations of the same module.  Fixed bug in parser related to
	setting the curr_packed global variable correctly.  Added enum2 and
	enum2.1 diagnostics to test suite to verify correct enumerate
	behavior for the changes made in this checkin.	Full regression now
	passes.

2006-10-16 11:12  phase1geo

	Fixing bug 1578251 and adding merge3 diagnostic to regression suite
	to verify it.

2006-10-16 11:10  phase1geo

	Adding merge3 diagnostic to regression suite to verify the
	development branch code for handling merging DUTs that contain the
	full hierarchy.

2006-10-13 17:46  phase1geo

	Things are a bit of a mess at this point.  Adding generate12
	diagnostic that shows a failure in properly handling generates of
	instances.

2006-10-13 11:11  phase1geo

	Cleaned up compiler warnings.

2006-10-13 10:56  phase1geo

	Updating rest of source files for compiler warnings.

2006-10-12 17:48  phase1geo

	Updates to remove compiler warnings.  Still some work left to go
	here.

2006-10-11 16:36  phase1geo

	Adding ifndef VPI around $dumpfile and $dumpvars calls to allow VPI
	testing.  Updated regressions for this change.

2006-10-10 22:48  phase1geo

	Updating build files.

2006-10-09 17:19  phase1geo

	Adding parser support for unpacked arrays of non-registers when
	operating in SystemVerilog mode.  Also fixed a small segmentation
	fault in the generate parsing logic.

2006-10-09 15:27  phase1geo

	Fixing simulator issue and adding parsing support for typedef'ed
	instantiations within modules.

2006-10-09 12:53  phase1geo

	Fixing support for VPI to allow it to properly get linked to the
	simulator.  Also fixed inconsistency in generate reports and
	updated appropriately in regressions for this change.  Full
	regression now passes.

2006-10-06 21:16  phase1geo

	Fixing bug in PEDGE and NEDGE expressions to make them completely
	compliant to the Verilog LRM.

2006-10-06 21:06  phase1geo

	Fixing bug in report command in that wait events were not being
	considered "covered" when they successfully passed in simulation. 
	Added wait1.1 diagnostic which found this bug.	Also added feature
	in VPI mode that will only get signals from simulator that it needs
	(rather than all of the signals).  This should improve performance
	when running in this mode.

2006-10-06 17:45  phase1geo

	Added support for the wait() statement.  Added wait1 diagnostic to
	regression suite to verify its behavior.  Also added missing GPL
	license note at the top of several *.h and *.c files that are
	somewhat new.

2006-10-06 13:36  phase1geo

	Updating regression runs and removing unnecessary output from
	expr.c.  Also added check_failures script to diagnostic verilog
	directory for future use.

2006-10-06 12:18  phase1geo

	Adding support for the final block type.  Added final1 diagnostic
	to regression suite.  Full regression passes.

2006-10-05 23:51  phase1geo

	Updating IV regression for latest round of changes.  Updated TODO
	list to indicate what has been worked on and its status.

2006-10-05 16:43  phase1geo

	Added support for increment and decrement operators in expressions.
	 Also added proper parsing and handling support for immediate and
	postponed increment/decrement.	Added inc3, inc3.1, dec3 and dec3.1
	diagnostics to verify this new functionality.  Still need to run
	regressions.

2006-10-04 22:55  phase1geo

	Updating/fixing user guide.  Also added page for describing how to
	understand memory coverage in a report.

2006-10-04 17:07  phase1geo

	Fixing bug found in development branch and fixing missing document
	links in user documentation.

2006-10-04 17:04  phase1geo

	Updating rest of regressions.  Modified the way we are setting the
	memory rd vector data bit (should optimize the score command just a
	bit).  Also updated quite a bit of memory coverage documentation
	though I still need to finish documenting how to understand the
	report file for this metric.  Cleaning up other things and fixing a
	few more software bugs from regressions.  Added marray2*
	diagnostics to verify endianness in the unpacked dimension list.

2006-10-04 03:23  phase1geo

	More documentation updates.  Everything should now be ready to
	document the memory coverage information.  Also added missing
	images for user documentation (this should probably be fixed in the
	stable branch as well).  Updated build files to suit.

2006-10-03 23:19  phase1geo

	Starting to make room for memory coverage user guide pages. 
	Finished through 010.html (need to modify the rest). 
	Checkpointing.

2006-10-03 17:46  phase1geo

	Adding support for read coverage to memories.  Also added memory
	coverage as a report output for DIAGLIST diagnostics in
	regressions.  Fixed various bugs left in code from array changes
	and updated regressions for these changes.  At this point, all IV
	diagnostics pass regressions.

2006-10-03 13:39  phase1geo

	Adding memory element selection feature in AME window of memory
	coverage window.  Also updated the memory window picture for this
	addition.

2006-10-02 22:23  phase1geo

	Updating lots of GUI documentation and images for addition of
	memory coverage and to update some parts that were incorrect.

2006-10-02 17:40  phase1geo

	Lots of bug fixes to memory coverage functionality for GUI.  Memory
	coverage should now be working correctly.  We just need to update
	the GUI documentation as well as other images for the new feature
	add.

2006-09-27 16:38  phase1geo

	Adding code to interract with data in memory coverage verbose
	window.  Majority of code is in place; however, this has not been
	thoroughly debugged at this point.  Adding mem3 diagnostic for GUI
	debugging purposes and checkpointing.

2006-09-26 17:36  phase1geo

	Adding code for memory coverage to GUI and related files.  Lots of
	work to go here so we are checkpointing for the moment.

2006-09-25 17:22  phase1geo

	Adding more support for memory reporting to both score and report
	commands.  We are getting closer; however, regressions are
	currently broken.  Checkpointing.

2006-09-24 23:15  phase1geo

	Starting to add support for new memory coverage metric.  This
	includes changes for the report command only at this point.

2006-09-23 14:40  phase1geo

	Fixing expression_assign, single and multi-bit select functions in
	expr.c to properly handle multi-dimensional arrays in both LHS and
	RHS expressions.  Added marray* diagnostics to verify proper
	behavior this new functionality for packed arrays (all endianness
	combinations).	Still a lot of testing to go, but this should be
	the majority of the code for now.  Full IV regression has been
	verified to pass.

2006-09-22 17:49  phase1geo

	Adding multidimensional array diagnostics to regression suite.	At
	this point, they do not all pass.  Also adding fixes to
	expression_assign() to get things to work.

2006-09-22 14:56  phase1geo

	Final set of fixes and regression updates per recent changes.  Full
	regression now passes.

2006-09-21 23:23  phase1geo

	More fixes to support new signal range structure.  Still don't have
	full regressions passing at the moment.

2006-09-21 22:31  phase1geo

	Preparing some files for the 0.4.8 stable release.

2006-09-21 17:44  phase1geo

	More updates to regressions for latest changes to support
	memories/multi-dimensional arrays.  We still have a handful of VCS
	diagnostics that are failing.  Checkpointing for now.

2006-09-20 23:20  phase1geo

	Fixing endianness diagnostics.	Still getting memory error with
	some diagnostics in regressions (ovl1 is one of them).	Updated
	regression.

2006-09-20 17:37  phase1geo

	Lots of changes to support memories and multi-dimensional arrays. 
	We still have issues with endianness and VCS regressions have not
	been run, but this is a significant amount of work that needs to be
	checkpointed.

2006-09-15 17:14  phase1geo

	Working on adding arrayed signals.  This is currently in progress
	and doesn't even compile at this point, much less work. 
	Checkpointing work.

2006-09-14 17:24  phase1geo

	Removing all regression comments from diagnostic files as these are
	not used and take up too much space on disk.

2006-09-14 12:46  phase1geo

	More regression updates.

2006-09-13 18:05  phase1geo

	Continuing from last submission.

2006-09-13 18:02  phase1geo

	Fixing bugs in bitwise coverage calculator.  Added report
	generation for bitwise coverage and associated -b option to the
	report command (this functionality has not been fully verified at
	this point yet).  Updated regressions which now fully pass.

2006-09-12 17:24  phase1geo

	Added first attempt at collecting bitwise coverage information
	during simulation.  Updated regressions for this change; however,
	we currently do not report on this information currently.  Also
	added missing keywords to GUI Verilog highlighter.  Checkpointing.

2006-09-12 17:23  phase1geo

	Added first attempt at collecting bitwise coverage information
	during simulation.  Updated regressions for this change; however,
	we currently do not report on this information currently. 
	Checkpointing.

2006-09-11 17:27  phase1geo

	Starting to work on supporting bitwise coverage.  Moving bits
	around in supplemental fields to allow this to work.  Full
	regression has been updated for the current changes though this
	feature is still not fully implemented at this time.  Also added
	parsing support for SystemVerilog program blocks (ignored) and
	final blocks (not handled properly at this time).  Also added lexer
	support for the return, void, continue, break, final, program and
	endprogram SystemVerilog keywords.  Checkpointing work.

2006-09-11 09:57  phase1geo

	Updating release information for 0.4.8 stable release.

2006-09-11 09:54  phase1geo

	Attempting to fix memory access problems during the db_close
	function.

2006-09-11 09:50  phase1geo

	Fixing error in parser for regressions.

2006-09-08 17:39  phase1geo

	Fixes for memory problems.

2006-09-08 09:56  phase1geo

	Somehow a return from the statement_find_statement function was
	missing that caused problems with removing statement blocks.

2006-09-07 16:59  phase1geo

	Fixing some bugs related to statement block removal.  Also made
	some significant optimizations to this code.

2006-09-07 10:10  phase1geo

	Fixing parsing problem when a named begin/end block was empty.

2006-09-06 17:09  phase1geo

	Fixing bug with multiply-and-op operation.  Also fixing bug in
	gen_item_resolve function where an instance was incorrectly being
	placed into a new instance tree.  Full regression passes with these
	changes.  Also removed verbose output.

2006-09-05 16:00  phase1geo

	Fixing bug in removing statements that are generate items.  Also
	added parsing support for multi-dimensional array accessing (no
	functionality here to support these, however).	Fixing bug in race
	condition checker for generated items.	Currently hitting into
	problem with genvars used in SBIT_SEL or MBIT_SEL type expressions
	-- we are hitting into an assertion error in
	expression_operate_recursively.
