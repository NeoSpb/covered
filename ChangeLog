2006-07-07 21:06  phase1geo

	Updating build scripts for next development release and fixing a
	bug in the score command that caused segfaults for signals that
	used the same parameters in their range declaration.  Added
	diagnostic to regression to test this fix.  Full regression passes.

2006-07-07 12:53  phase1geo

	Updates to build files, changelog and NEWS for upcoming
	covered-20060708 development release.  Removed the ability for the
	covered RPM to be relocatable as this would cause problems with
	locating the Tcl/Tk scripts and GUI documentation.

2006-07-06 22:15  phase1geo

	More updates to the RPM spec file (this is not working well with
	Tcl/Tk).

2006-07-06 21:44  phase1geo

	Updating the covered.spec RPM build file and updating the build
	scripts.

2006-07-06 16:17  phase1geo

	Adding the initial version of a base RPM spec file for RPM building
	purposes.  This is totally untested at this point but I need to
	checkpoint.

2006-07-06 15:29  phase1geo

	Updating all GUI documentation to include new features added to
	this development version of Covered.  I believe all of the
	documentation now accurately reflects the state of the GUI.

2006-07-06 00:43  phase1geo

	More documentation and build script updates.

2006-07-06 00:38  phase1geo

	Updating documentation and adding missing image files for GUI
	documentation.	Also updated the build files.

2006-07-05 16:04  phase1geo

	Adding new png files for GUI documentation and updating other
	documentation details.

2006-07-05 15:45  phase1geo

	Updating TODO and fixing default option in .coveredrc file.

2006-07-05 15:43  phase1geo

	Finishing Tcl/Tk work on preferences window and report generator
	window.  Started work on GUI HTML documentation for these changes. 
	A lot of documentation left to do here, but all of the missing
	files are now in place.

2006-07-04 23:41  phase1geo

	Updating preferences window to enhance its usage (and
	expandability).  Added report options to the preferences window. 
	Still have a little ways to go to fully complete the new
	preferences window usage for report options.

2006-06-30 22:16  phase1geo

	Completed work on ASCII report generation.  This has not been
	entirely tested out at this time.

2006-06-30 16:05  phase1geo

	Updating TODO and adding the ASCII report generation window.  Still
	some work to do here before this completely works.  Right now I am
	wrestling with the window manager to place the components where I
	want them...

2006-06-29 17:44  phase1geo

	Fixing newly introduced bug in FSM report handler.  Also adding
	pointers back to main text window when exclusion properties are
	changed.  Fixing toggle coverage retension.  This is partially
	working but doesn't seem to want to save/restore properly at this
	point.

2006-06-29 15:57  phase1geo

	Added stmt_excluded bit to expression to allow us to individually
	control line and combinational logic exclusion.  This also allows
	us to exclude combinational logic within excluded lines.  Also
	fixing problem with highlighting the listbox (due to recent
	changes).

2006-06-29 15:06  phase1geo

	Adding assertion exclusion code.  Things seem to be working
	properly with this now.  This concludes the initial version of code
	exclusion.  There are some things to clean up (and maybe make
	better looking).

2006-06-29 11:48  phase1geo

	FSM exclusion code now complete.

2006-06-28 23:26  phase1geo

	More updates for FSM coverage.	We are getting close but are just
	not to fully working order yet.

2006-06-28 17:15  phase1geo

	Adding more code to support FSM coverage.  Still a ways to go
	before this is completed.

2006-06-28 00:11  phase1geo

	Starting to work on FSM exclusion/inclusion functionality.  Bound
	uncovered rectanges to commands at this point.

2006-06-27 23:35  phase1geo

	Adding support for line coverage and fixing toggle and
	combinational coverage to redisplay main textbox to reflect
	exclusion changes.  Also added messageBox for close and exit menu
	options when a CDD has been changed but not saved to allow the user
	to do so before continuing on.

2006-06-27 17:06  phase1geo

	Fixing more code related to exclusion.	The detailed combinational
	expression window now works correctly.	I am currently working on
	getting the main window text viewer to display exclusion correctly
	for all coverage metrics.  Still have a ways to go here.

2006-06-27 14:34  phase1geo

	Permanent fix for the CDD save feature.

2006-06-26 17:48  phase1geo

	More updates for exclusion of combinational logic.  Also updates to
	properly support CDD saving; however, this change causes regression
	errors, currently.

2006-06-25 23:12  phase1geo

	More updates for supporting coverage exclusion.  Still a bit more
	to go before this is working properly.

2006-06-23 16:43  phase1geo

	More updates to include toggle exclusion (this does not work
	correctly at this time).

2006-06-23 14:45  phase1geo

	Adding full C support for excluding/including coverage points. 
	Fixed regression suite failures -- full regression now passes.	We
	just need to start adding support to the Tcl/Tk files for full
	user-specified exclusion support.

2006-06-23 00:12  phase1geo

	Moving some of the diagnostics ear-marked VCS-only to the general
	diagnostic pool as the newer versions of Icarus Verilog produce the
	same result as VCS without generating any errors.

2006-06-22 23:24  phase1geo

	Adding functions to tcl_funcs to allow us to change the exclusion
	property for each coverage metric.

2006-06-22 23:03  phase1geo

	Updating build files and removing syntax errors in exclude.h and
	exclude.c (though this code doesn't do anything meaningful at this
	point).

2006-06-22 16:56  phase1geo

	Adding excluded bits to signal and arc structures and changed
	statistic gathering functions to not gather coverage for excluded
	structures.  Started to work on exclude.c file which will quickly
	adjust coverage information from GUI modifications.  Regression has
	been updated for this change and it fully passes.

2006-06-21 14:51  phase1geo

	Updating the README to include information for where to find GUI
	documentation.

2006-06-21 14:48  phase1geo

	Updating TODO and incrementing version information in configure.in.

2006-06-21 14:44  phase1geo

	Adding exclusion bit to expression supplemental field and
	incrementing CDD version number as a result.  No functionality to
	support excluding has been added at this point.  Full regression
	now passes.

2006-06-21 13:58  phase1geo

	More updates for saving CDD files.  Also added missing support for
	assertion coverage to preferences window and summary window.  Also
	updated the initial .coveredrc configuration file that gets
	installed with a Covered installation.

2006-06-20 21:56  phase1geo

	Fixing assertion error in info.c for merged file writing.

2006-06-20 21:41  phase1geo

	Fixing multi-file opening code.

2006-06-20 17:14  phase1geo

	Adding support for saving CDD files (needed for file merging and
	saving exclusion information for a CDD file) in the GUI.  Still
	have a bit to go as I am getting core dumps to occur.

2006-06-16 17:44  phase1geo

	Beginning to add ability to open/close CDD files without needing to
	close Covered's GUI.  This seems to work but does cause some
	segfaults yet.

2006-05-30 13:57  phase1geo

	Fixing small documentation error on main page.

2006-05-30 13:09  phase1geo

	Updating regressions for vcs runs.
