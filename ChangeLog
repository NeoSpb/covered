2006-02-17 17:19  phase1geo

	More updates to run script -- this is still not working exactly the
	way that I would like it to but I may need to rethink the
	diagnostic header stuff more.

2006-02-17 13:50  phase1geo

	Added full support for escaped names.  Full regression passes.

2006-02-16 15:19  phase1geo

	Adding support for arrays of instances.  Also fixing some memory
	problems for constant functions and fixed binding problems when
	hierarchical references are made to merged modules.  Full
	regression now passes.

2006-02-15 23:33  phase1geo

	More additions to regression script.  Need to do lots of debugging.
	 add1.v diagnostic contains initial support for new regression
	style.

2006-02-13 10:19  phase1geo

	Code cleanup.

2006-02-13 09:42  phase1geo

	Adding support for NULL expressions in parameter override
	expression lists.  In VCS, this simply skips overriding the Nth
	parameter -- Covered does the same.  Full regression now passes.

2006-02-13 08:23  phase1geo

	Started work on Perl run script for regressions and single
	diagnostic runs.

2006-02-10 16:10  phase1geo

	Added support for initially parsing files with the `line directive.
	 Added diagnostic to verify this functionality.  Updated TODO. 
	Full regression passes.

2006-02-10 15:05  phase1geo

	Added support for `elsif directive.  Diagnostics added to verify
	functionality.	Full regression passes.

2006-02-10 10:44  phase1geo

	Adding support for register assignment.  Added diagnostic to
	regression suite to verify its implementation.	Updated TODO.  Full
	regression passes at this point.

2006-02-10 00:57  phase1geo

	Final updates to GUI documentation and images for current GUI.	All
	GUI documentation has been verified to install correctly and
	accurately reflects the current state of the GUI.  Whew!  Updated
	TODO.  Cleaned up a bunch of unused GUI documentation files and
	images.

2006-02-09 21:08  phase1geo

	More fixes to navigational buttons and adding functionality to
	"Show current selection" menu item in view menu.  Now everything
	seems to be working as wanted.	We should now be ready to finish
	the GUI documentation.

2006-02-09 17:23  phase1geo

	Fixing more GUI bugs.  Added navigational menu items and put in
	functional support for this navigation.  Things seem to be working
	now for the most part.

2006-02-09 08:23  phase1geo

	Adding next and previous buttons to combinational logic detail
	window.  Functionality not complete at this time.

2006-02-08 17:34  phase1geo

	Lots of enhancements and bug fixes to GUI.  Added next and previous
	buttons in main window for finding uncovered metrics quickly
	(although there is no functionality to these buttons currently).

2006-02-08 07:54  phase1geo

	Adding previous and next buttons to toggle window.  Added currently
	selected cursor output to main textbox with associated
	functionality.

2006-02-07 21:57  phase1geo

	Adding new signed diagnostics to test >, <, >=, <=, == and !=
	operations on signed values.  Full regression passes at this point.

2006-02-06 16:48  phase1geo

	Several enhancements to GUI look and feel.  Fixed error in
	combinational logic window.

2006-02-06 09:35  phase1geo

	Fixing bug with -f option when the file is empty (previously
	segfaulted).

2006-02-05 23:10  phase1geo

	Adding *.png files for GUI documentation.

2006-02-05 23:07  phase1geo

	Fixed expression_set_static_only function to consider static
	expressions properly.  Updated regression as a result of this
	change.  Added files for signed3 diagnostic.  Documentation updates
	for GUI (these are not quite complete at this time yet).

2006-02-03 17:49  phase1geo

	More fixes to support signed comparison and propagation.  Still
	more testing to do here before I call it good.	Regression may fail
	at this point.

2006-02-02 21:11  phase1geo

	Fixing errors in GUI display of combinational logic coverage.  I
	still see a few problems here that need to be taken care of,
	however.

2006-02-02 16:36  phase1geo

	Starting to put in support for signed values and inline register
	initialization.  Also added support for more attribute locations in
	code.  Regression updated for these changes.  Interestingly, with
	the changes that were made to the parser, signals are output to
	reports in order (before they were completely reversed).  This is a
	nice surprise...  Full regression passes.

2006-02-01 23:42  phase1geo

	Adding missing documentation and image files from last checkin.

2006-02-01 23:40  phase1geo

	Several documentation updates as well as added help buttons to
	preferences and summary windows.

	Adding more diagnostics to regression suite.  Full regression
	passes.

2006-02-01 13:58  phase1geo

	More updates to allow parsing of various parameter formats.  At
	this point I believe full parameter support is functional. 
	Regression has been updated which now completely passes.  A few new
	diagnostics have been added to the testsuite to verify additional
	functionality that is supported.

2006-02-01 09:13  phase1geo

	Added support for handling bit selections in RHS parameter
	calculations.  New mbit_sel5.4 diagnostic added to verify this
	change.  Added the start of a regression utility that will
	eventually replace the old Makefile system.

2006-01-31 10:40  phase1geo

	Adding initial support and diagnostics for the variable multi-bit
	select operators +: and -:.  More to come but full regression
	passes.

2006-01-30 00:03  phase1geo

	Documentation updates for LXT dumpfile option and Verilog-2001
	supported constructs.

2006-01-28 00:42  phase1geo

	Added configuration read/write functionality for tool preferences
	and integrated the preferences.tcl file into Covered's GUI.  This
	is now functioning correctly.

2006-01-27 21:04  phase1geo

	Updating Makefile.in in scripts directory to include the
	preferences.tcl file.

2006-01-27 17:46  phase1geo

	Adding initial preferences window.  Looks good at this point but we
	still need to properly tie this into the main program.

2006-01-27 09:43  phase1geo

	Added ifdefs for HAVE_ZLIB define to allow Covered to compile
	correctly when zlib.h and associated library is unavailable.  Also
	handle dumpfile reading appropriately for this condition.  Moved
	report file opening after the CDD file has been read in to avoid
	empty report files when a problem is detected in the CDD file.

2006-01-27 08:19  phase1geo

	Updating configuration files.

2006-01-26 17:43  phase1geo

	Fixing coredump problem when we have a problem reading the LXT
	file.

2006-01-26 17:20  phase1geo

	Reworking diagnostic Makefiles to include the ability to test LXT
	support in regressions.

2006-01-26 16:40  phase1geo

	Fixing last LXT bug.

2006-01-26 11:34  phase1geo

	Finished work on lxt2_read.c and fixed bug in LXT-based simulator. 
	Also adding missing lxt.h header file.

2006-01-26 00:07  phase1geo

	Build updates.

2006-01-26 00:06  phase1geo

	Starting to work on formatting the lxt2_read file and improving
	error output to conform to Covered's error-reporting mechanism.

2006-01-25 16:48  phase1geo

	Updating TODO status.

2006-01-25 16:13  phase1geo

	Adding LXT-style dumpfile parsing support.  Everything is wired in
	but I still need to look at a problem at the end of the dumpfile --
	I'm getting coredumps when using the new -lxt option.  I also need
	to disable LXT code if the z library is missing along with
	documenting the new feature in the user's guide and man page.

2006-01-25 10:51  phase1geo

	Fixing performance/output issue with hierarchical references. 
	Added support for hierarchical references to parser.  Full
	regression passes.

2006-01-24 22:33  phase1geo

	Updating TODO.

2006-01-24 22:32  phase1geo

	Fixing bug with latest checkins.  Full regression is now passing
	for IV simulated diagnostics.

2006-01-24 17:33  phase1geo

	A few cleanups.

2006-01-24 17:24  phase1geo

	More updates to handle static functions properly.  I have redone
	quite a bit of code here which has regressions pretty broke at the
	moment.  More work to do but I'm checkpointing.

2006-01-23 16:57  phase1geo

	Updating TODO file.

2006-01-23 16:55  phase1geo

	Updates to fix constant function support.  There is some issues to
	resolve here but full regression is passing with the exception of
	the newly added static_func1.1 diagnostic.  Fixed problem where
	expand and multi-bit expressions were getting coverage numbers
	calculated for them before they were simulated.

2006-01-23 11:23  phase1geo

	Fixing scope issues that came up when port assignment was added. 
	Full regression now passes.

2006-01-22 21:53  phase1geo

	Adding support for input/output ports of tasks/functions. 
	Regressions are not running cleanly at this point so there is still
	some work to do here.  Checkpointing.

2006-01-20 16:50  phase1geo

	Code cleanup.

2006-01-20 16:44  phase1geo

	Moving parameter resolution to post-bind stage to allow static
	functions to be considered.  Regression passes without static
	function testing.  Static function support still has some work to
	go.  Checkpointing.

2006-01-20 13:27  phase1geo

	Fixing compile warning.

2006-01-20 13:15  phase1geo

	Fixed bug to properly handle the scoping of parameters when
	parameters are created/used in non-module functional units.  Added
	param10*.v diagnostics to regression suite to verify the behavior
	is correct now.

2006-01-19 23:52  phase1geo

	Adding new diagnostic to test suite to test parameter usage
	situation that has not been tested to this point.

2006-01-19 17:29  phase1geo

	Fixing bug from last checkin in tcl_funcs.c (infinite looping). 
	Small updates to menu.

2006-01-19 17:08  phase1geo

	Adding line and starting column information to vsignal structure
	(and associated CDD files).  Regression has been fully updated for
	this change which now fully passes.  Final changes to summary GUI. 
	Fixed signal underlining for toggle coverage to work for both
	explicit and implicit signals.	Getting things ready for a
	preferences window.

2006-01-18 18:01  phase1geo

	Lots of changes/additions.  Summary report window work is now
	complete (with the exception of adding extra features).  Added
	support for parsing left and right shift operators and the exponent
	operator in static expression scenarios.  Fixed issues related to
	GUI (due to recent changes in the score command).  Things seem to
	be generally working as expected with the GUI now.

2006-01-17 23:39  phase1geo

	More updates to summary.tcl.  Still not there yet.

2006-01-17 17:38  phase1geo

	Adding very beginning of a summary window.  This is totally
	incomplete at this point.

2006-01-17 17:08  phase1geo

	Updating VCS version of regression per last weeks changes.  Full
	regression now passes.

2006-01-16 12:10  phase1geo

	Causing all error information to get sent to stderr no matter what
	mode we are in.  Updating error diagnostics for this change.  Full
	regression now passes.

2006-01-16 11:27  phase1geo

	Fixing binding issues when designs have modules/tasks/functions
	that are either used more than once in a design or have the same
	name.  Full regression now passes.

2006-01-13 22:17  phase1geo

	Adding is_func_unit function to check to see if a -e value is a
	valid module, function, task or named begin/end block.	Updated
	regression accordingly.  We are getting closer but still have a few
	diagnostics to figure out yet.

2006-01-13 17:27  phase1geo

	Initial attempt to fix problem with handling functions/tasks/named
	blocks with the same name in the design.  Still have a few
	diagnostics failing in regressions to contend with.  Updating
	regression with these changes.

2006-01-13 07:42  phase1geo

	Added task4 diagnostic to recreate bug found in the field.

2006-01-12 22:01  phase1geo

	Adding support for exponential operation.  Added exponent1
	diagnostic to verify but Icarus does not support this currently.

2006-01-12 17:14  phase1geo

	Added test to verify defparam overridding of localparams cannot
	occur.	Updated TODO file to list which Verilog-2001 constructs are
	currently supported.  Full regression passes.

2006-01-12 16:52  phase1geo

	Adding support for localparam construct.  Added tests to regression
	suite to verify correct functionality.	Full regression passes.

2006-01-12 16:14  phase1geo

	Completed code for handling parameter value pass by name
	Verilog-2001 syntax.  Added diagnostics to regression suite and
	updated regression files for this change.  Full regression now
	passes.

2006-01-11 13:57  phase1geo

	Added diagnostics to verify proper handling of inline parameters,
	inline port declarations and added is_signed bit to vector
	supplemental field (though we still do not handle signed values
	appropriately).

2006-01-11 13:50  phase1geo

	Added diagnostics to verify proper handling of inline parameters,
	inline port declarations and added is_signed bit to vector
	supplemental field (though we still do not handle signed values
	appropriately).

2006-01-10 23:38  phase1geo

	Fixing Verilog-2001 inline port declaration.  This now seems to be
	working properly.  Started adding support for register assignment
	to inline port declaration -- not finished yet but can parse.

2006-01-10 17:13  phase1geo

	Completed support for implicit event sensitivity list.	Added
	diagnostics to verify this new capability.  Also started support
	for parsing inline parameters and port declarations (though this is
	probably not complete and not passing at this point). 
	Checkpointing.

2006-01-09 23:56  phase1geo

	In the middle of adding support for event sensitivity lists to
	score command.	Regressions should pass but this code is not
	complete at this time.

2006-01-09 23:18  phase1geo

	Adding ashift2 diagnostic to regression suite to verify report
	output of arithmetic shift operations.

2006-01-09 23:12  phase1geo

	Updating NEWS file for cleanup function adds.

2006-01-09 12:58  phase1geo

	Updating regression for VCS runs.  Added cleanup function at exit
	to remove the tmp* file (if it exists) regardless of the internal
	state of Covered at the time of exit (removes the need for the user
	to remove this file when things go awry).  Documentation updates
	for this feature.

2006-01-09 00:11  phase1geo

	Adding -S option documentation to man page for score command.

	vcs regression and update these files before we can fully release.

2006-01-08 22:52  phase1geo

	Updating regression.  Full regression now passes.

2006-01-08 22:15  phase1geo

	Attempting to fix one last problem with latest changes.  Regression
	runs are currently running.  Checkpointing.

2006-01-07 23:51  phase1geo

	Added optimizations to EOR and AEDGE expressions.  In the process
	of running regressions...

2006-01-07 21:05  phase1geo

	Checkpointing work on optimized thread handling.  I believe that
	this is now working as wanted; however, regressions will not pass
	until EOR optimization has been completed.  I will be working on
	this next.

2006-01-06 17:39  phase1geo

	Started working on removing the need to simulate more than is
	necessary.  Things are pretty broken at this point, but all of the
	code should be in -- debugging.

2006-01-06 12:54  phase1geo

	Breaking up expression_operate function into individual functions
	for each expression operation.	Also storing additional information
	in a globally accessible, constant structure array to increase
	performance.  Updating full regression for these changes.  Full
	regression passes.

2006-01-04 23:56  phase1geo

	Updated TODO.

2006-01-04 23:52  phase1geo

	Removing wait bit in vector supplemental field and modifying
	algorithm to only assign in the post-sim location (pre-sim now is
	gone).	This fixes some issues with simulation results and
	increases performance a bit.  Updated regressions for these
	changes.  Full regression passes.

2006-01-04 16:07  phase1geo

	Changing expression execution calculation from sim to
	expression_operate function.  Updating all regression files for
	this change.  Modifications to diagnostic Makefile to accommodate
	environments that do not have valgrind.

2006-01-03 21:15  phase1geo

	Adding bassign3 diagnostic to regression suite to verify
	expression_assign function works correctly for CONCAT/LIST
	ordering.

2006-01-03 17:00  phase1geo

	Removing debugging output from last checkin.

2006-01-03 16:59  phase1geo

	Fixing bug in expression_assign function -- removed recursive
	assignment when the LHS expression is a signal, single-bit,
	multi-bit or static value (only recurse when the LHS is a CONCAT or
	LIST).	Fixing bug in db_close function to check if the instance
	tree has been populated before deallocating memory for it.  Fixing
	bug in report help information when Tcl/Tk is not available.  Added
	bassign2 diagnostic to regression suite to verify first described
	bug.

2006-01-02 15:35  phase1geo

	Added simulation performance statistical information to end of
	score command when we are in debug mode.

2005-12-30 23:00  phase1geo

	Updating regression due to recent changes in adding exec_num field
	in expression and removing the executed bit in the expression
	supplemental field.  This will eventually allow us to get
	information on where the simulator is spending the most time.

2005-12-30 21:30  phase1geo

	Various documentation updates.

2005-12-23 14:59  phase1geo

	Fixing assertion error in race condition checker.  Full regression
	runs cleanly.

2005-12-22 23:41  phase1geo

	Fixing several bugs in score command per bug report #1388339. 
	Fixed problem with race condition checker statement iterator to
	eliminate infinite looping (this was the problem in the original
	bug).  Also fixed expression assigment when static expressions are
	used in the LHS (caused an assertion failure).	Also fixed the race
	condition checker to properly pay attention to task calls, named
	blocks and fork statements to make sure that these are being
	handled correctly for race condition checking.	Fixed bug for
	signals that are on the LHS side of an assignment expression but is
	not being assigned (bit selects) so that these are NOT considered
	for race conditions.  Full regression is a bit broken now but the
	opened bug can now be closed.

2005-12-22 17:04  phase1geo

	More memory leak fixes.

	errors.  Also added suppression file for valgrind for a memory leak
	problem that exists in lex-generated code.

2005-12-20 23:10  phase1geo

	Removing excess verbage from run.

2005-12-19 17:11  phase1geo

	now been eliminated from regression -- just left-over memory issues
	remain.

2005-12-18 23:18  phase1geo

	Fixing memory leak problems with instance1.1.  Full regression has
	some segfaults that need to be looked at now.

2005-12-16 23:47  phase1geo

	More memory fault fixes.  Regression runs cleanly and we have
	verified no memory faults up to define3.v.  Still have a ways to
	go.

2005-12-16 17:26  phase1geo

	Last set of memory leak fixes to get all assign diagnostics to run
	cleanly.

	memory.  Updated assign1.cdd file.

2005-12-15 11:24  phase1geo

	More fixes for memory fault clean-up.  At this point all of the
	always diagnostics have been run and come up clean with valgrind. 
	Full regression passes.

2005-12-14 17:25  phase1geo

	Checkpointing some more memory fault fixes.

2005-12-14 17:03  phase1geo

	More fixes for memory leaks.  Regression fully passes at this
	point.

2005-12-12 17:25  phase1geo

	regression which now fully passes.

2005-12-10 00:41  phase1geo

	Added support for FOR loops and added diagnostics to regression
	suite to verify functionality.	Fixed statement deallocation
	function (removed a bunch of code there now that statement stopping
	is working as intended).  Full regression passes.

2005-12-08 16:50  phase1geo

	Adding support for while loops.  Added while1 and while1.1 to
	regression suite.  Ran VCS on regression suite and updated.  Full
	regression passes.

2005-12-08 13:46  phase1geo

	Fixed repeat2 simulation issues.  Fixed statement_connect
	algorithm, removed the need for a separate set_stop function and
	reshuffled the positions of esuppl bits.  Full regression passes.

2005-12-07 16:02  phase1geo

	Added new repeat2 diagnostic to regression suite.  This brings out
	a statement_connect error that still needs to be looked at --
	currently causes just this diagnostic to segfault.

2005-12-07 15:50  phase1geo

	Added support for repeat blocks.  Added repeat1 to regression and
	fixed errors.  Full regression passes.

2005-12-07 14:23  phase1geo

	Fixing case where statement is unconnectable.  Full regression now
	passes.

2005-12-06 13:40  phase1geo

	Updating regression for VCS run.  Added regression restart ability
	to Makefiles when problems/errors occur for a given regression run
	(only reruns failed/unrun diagnostics the next time a regression is
	run).  Full regression passes at this point.

2005-12-06 09:42  phase1geo

	Added disable2.1 diagnostic to regression suite.  Fixed bad output
	from line coverage reports.  Full regression passes.

2005-12-05 17:30  phase1geo

	Adding support for disabling tasks.  Full regression passes.

2005-12-05 16:45  phase1geo

	Bug fixes to disable code when disabling ourselves -- we move
	thread killing to be done by the sim_thread routine only.

2005-12-05 16:02  phase1geo

	Added initial support for disable expression.  Added test to verify
	functionality.	Full regression passes.

2005-12-05 15:28  phase1geo

	Getting fork statements with scope to work.  Added test to
	regression to verify this functionality.  Fixed bug in binding
	expression to named block.

2005-12-05 14:26  phase1geo

	Fixing bugs in code to remove statement blocks that are pointed to
	by expressions in NB_CALL and FORK cases.  Fixed bugs in fork code
	-- this is now working at the moment.  Updated regressions which
	now fully pass.

2005-12-02 13:58  phase1geo

	Added initial support for FORK/JOIN expressions.  Code is not
	working correctly yet as we need to determine if a statement should
	be done in parallel or not.

2005-12-02 06:03  phase1geo

	Adding support for excluding functions, tasks and named blocks. 
	Added tests to regression suite to verify this support.  Full
	regression passes.

2005-12-01 23:46  phase1geo

	Fixing compile errors when HAVE_TCLTK is defined in config.h.

2005-12-01 16:17  phase1geo

	Adding new diagnostics to test exclusion properties of modules,
	functions, tasks and named_blocks.  Full regression fails at this
	point with most of new diagnostics.

2005-12-01 15:11  phase1geo

	Adding more error checking diagnostics into regression suite.  Full
	regression passes.

2005-12-01 14:49  phase1geo

	Adding nested_block3 to verify nested named blocks in tasks.  Fixed
	named block usage to be FUNC_CALL or TASK_CALL -like based on its
	placement.

2005-12-01 13:46  phase1geo

	Removed Tcl/Tk from source files if HAVE_TCLTK is not defined.

2005-12-01 12:35  phase1geo

	Fixing bug where functions in continuous assignments could cause
	the assignment to constantly be reevaluated (infinite looping). 
	Added new nested_block2 diagnostic to verify nested named blocks in
	functions.  Also verifies that nested named blocks can call
	functions in the same module.  Also modified NB_CALL expressions to
	act like functions (no context switching involved).  Full
	regression passes.

2005-12-01 10:08  phase1geo

	Allowing nested functional units within a module to get parsed and
	handled correctly.  Added new nested_block1 diagnostic to test
	nested named blocks -- will add more tests later for different
	combinations.  Updated regression suite which now passes.

2005-11-30 12:25  phase1geo

	Fixing named block code.  Full regression now passes.  Still more
	work to do on named blocks, however.

2005-11-29 17:14  phase1geo

	Adding support for named blocks.  Still not working at this point
	but checkpointing anyways.  Added new task3.1 diagnostic to verify
	task removal when a task is calling another task.

2005-11-29 13:04  phase1geo

	Adding tests to verify task functionality.  Updating failing tests
	and fixed bugs for context switch expressions at the end of a
	statement block, statement block removal for missing function/tasks
	and thread killing.

2005-11-29 09:02  phase1geo

	Adding task3 diagnostic to regression suite.

2005-11-28 17:28  phase1geo

	Checkpointing with additions for threads.

2005-11-28 12:31  phase1geo

	Fixing memory fault bug in expression deallocation algorithm.

2005-11-27 23:45  phase1geo

	Adding new task diagnostics to regression suite.

2005-11-25 16:03  phase1geo

	Fixing bugs in race condition checker when racing statement blocks
	are in different functional units.  Still some work to do here with
	what to do when conflicting statement block is in a task/function
	(I suppose we need to remove the calling statement block as well?)

2005-11-25 10:48  phase1geo

	Fixing bugs in binding algorithm.  Full regression now passes.

2005-11-23 17:10  phase1geo

	Updating TODO.

2005-11-23 17:05  phase1geo

	Updating regression files.  Full regression now passes.

2005-11-23 17:03  phase1geo

	Fixing statement block removal to do it after binding and race
	condition checking.

2005-11-22 17:03  phase1geo

	Adding support for event trigger mechanism.  Regression is
	currently broke due to these changes -- we need to remove statement
	blocks that contain triggers that are not simulated.

2005-11-22 10:46  phase1geo

	Fixed bug with clearing the assigned bit in the binding phase. 
	Full regression now runs cleanly.

2005-11-21 23:30  phase1geo

	Updates to regression suite for clearing the assigned bit when a
	statement block is removed from coverage consideration and it is
	assigning that signal.	This is not fully working at this point.

2005-11-21 17:31  phase1geo

	Adding support for initial statement blocks.  Added first initial1
	diagnostic to regression suite.  This support seems to be working
	for the moment -- still need to run regressions.

2005-11-21 16:21  phase1geo

	More regression updates.  Also made some updates to debugging
	output.

2005-11-20 22:37  phase1geo

	Miscellaneous updates.

2005-11-20 22:17  phase1geo

	More updates to regression suite -- includes several bug fixes. 
	Also added --enable-debug facility to configuration file which will
	include or exclude debugging output from being generated.

2005-11-18 17:52  phase1geo

	More regression cleanup -- still quite a few errors to handle here.

2005-11-17 23:17  phase1geo

	Updating regressions with latest round of changes.  Also added
	bit-fill capability to expression_assign function -- still more
	changes to come.  We need to fix the expression sizing problem for
	RHS expressions of assignment operators.

2005-11-17 17:35  phase1geo

	Blocking assignment is now working properly along with support for
	event expressions (currently only the original PEDGE, NEDGE, AEDGE
	and DELAY are supported but more can now follow).  Added new race4
	diagnostic to verify that a register cannot be assigned from more
	than one location -- this works.  Regression fails at this point.

2005-11-16 23:34  phase1geo

	Initial work on supporting blocking assignments.  Added new
	diagnostic to check that this initial work is working correctly. 
	Quite a bit more work to do here.

2005-11-16 17:02  phase1geo

	Added new diagnostics to check for functions that contain
	time-consuming expressions (this is not allowed by Covered -- and
	not by most commercial simulators either).  Updated check_test to
	do error checking and added error outputs.  Full regression passes
	at this point -- 225 diagnostics.

2005-11-16 16:07  phase1geo

	Now full regression runs without error.

2005-11-16 16:01  phase1geo

	Fixing more problems related to simulation of function/task calls. 
	Regression runs are now running without errors.

2005-11-16 13:47  phase1geo

	Updating VCS-only diagnostic files.

2005-11-15 23:50  phase1geo

	Fixing binding with merge command.

2005-11-15 23:41  phase1geo

	Fixing implicit signal creation in binding functions.

2005-11-15 17:08  phase1geo

	Updates for new binding scheme.  Binding occurs for all
	expressions, signals, FSMs, and functional units after parsing has
	completed or after database reading has been completed.  This
	should allow for any hierarchical reference or scope issues to be
	handled correctly.  Regression mostly passes but there are still a
	few failures at this point.  Checkpointing.

2005-11-11 17:29  phase1geo

	Checkpointing some work in progress.  This will cause compile
	errors.  In the process of moving db read expression signal binding
	from vsignal output to expression output so that we can just call
	the binder in the expression_db_read function.

2005-11-11 16:53  phase1geo

	Updated bind process to allow binding of structures from different
	hierarchies.  Added task port signals to get added.

2005-11-10 17:27  phase1geo

	Adding scope files to handle scope searching.  The functions are
	complete (not debugged) but are not as of yet used anywhere in the
	code.  Added new func2 diagnostic which brings out scoping issues
	for functions.

2005-11-10 13:28  phase1geo

	Updates/fixes for tasks/functions.  Also updated Tcl/Tk scripts for
	these changes.	Fixed bug with net_decl_assign statements -- the
	line, start column and end column information was incorrect,
	causing problems with the GUI output.

2005-11-08 17:11  phase1geo

	Fixes for function/task additions.  Still a lot of testing on these
	structures; however, regressions now pass again so we are
	checkpointing here.

2005-06-23 11:06  phase1geo

	Updating report files due to extra space for module/instance name.

2005-06-15 17:13  phase1geo

	Updates to include signal callbacks and integration with Covered's
	simulation core.

2005-06-10 17:26  phase1geo

	Adding symlinks to needed files.

2005-06-10 15:50  phase1geo

	Initial addition of vpi source files (just trying to get them into
	the database for now).

2005-05-11 07:39  phase1geo

	Removed vpi_user.h to allow us to work with other simulators or
	other versions of Icarus Verilog.

2005-05-08 22:08  phase1geo

	Intermediate checkin for VPI changes.  Also contains parser fix
	which should be branch applied to the latest stable and development
	versions.

2005-05-02 10:38  phase1geo

	Potential fix for older release backward compatibility.

2005-05-02 10:33  phase1geo

	Updates.

2005-05-02 00:00  phase1geo

	Start of adding VPI support to Covered.  Still a ways to go at this
	point.

2005-03-04 23:16  phase1geo

	Adding patch to parser.y to fix compiling problems with parser.y
	via bison-2.0.

2005-02-16 07:44  phase1geo

	Adding value propagation function to vsignal.c and adding this
	propagation to BASSIGN expression assignment after the assignment
	occurs.

2005-02-11 16:58  phase1geo

	Missed a file from the last submission.

2005-02-11 16:49  phase1geo

	Fixing bug with removing statement blocks that contain statements
	that cannot currently be handled by Covered correctly.	There was a
	problem when the bad statement was the last statement in the
	statement block.  Updated regression accordingly.  Added race
	condition diagnostics that currently are not in regression due to
	lack of code support for them.	Ifdef'ed out the BASSIGN stuff for
	this checkin.

2005-02-09 08:11  phase1geo

	More code for supporting expression assignments.

2005-02-08 17:18  phase1geo

	Starting to add code to handle expression assignment for blocking
	assignments.  At this point, regressions will probably still pass
	but new code isn't doing exactly what I want.

2005-02-07 22:05  phase1geo

	Final checkin for next development release.

2005-02-07 17:47  phase1geo

	Updating NEWS and ChangeLog for upcoming development release.

	Added code to output race condition reasons to informational bar. 
	Also added code to output toggle and combinational logic output to
	information bar when cursor is over an expression that, when
	clicked on, will take you to the detailed coverage window.

2005-02-07 11:37  phase1geo

	Fixing bug in process_file.tcl script where start_line and end_line
	global variables were being assigned when they should not have
	been.

2005-02-06 23:10  phase1geo

	Fixing bug in statement_get_last_line calculator.  Updated

2005-02-05 00:47  phase1geo

	Fixing bug with race condition output in instance reporting. 
	Changing default report output of race conditions to false and
	updating in-line documentation.  Added rules in regression runs for
	specifically testing race condition output.  Updated regression
	files for these changes.  Regression runs clean at this point.	We
	just need to add user documentation for the race condition feature
	add and we should be done.

2005-02-05 00:20  phase1geo

	Added ascii report output for race conditions.	There is a
	segmentation fault bug associated with instance reporting.  Need to
	look into further.

2005-02-04 23:29  phase1geo

	Added race condition reporting to GUI.

2005-02-04 22:13  phase1geo

	Started to add reporting capabilities for race condition
	information.  Modified race condition reason calculation and
	handling.  Ran -Wall on all code and cleaned things up.  Cleaned up
	regression as a result of these changes.  Full regression now
	passes.

2005-02-04 17:55  phase1geo

	Adding code to support race condition information in CDD files. 
	All code is now in place for writing/reading this data to/from the
	CDD file (although nothing is currently done with it and it is
	currently untested).

2005-02-04 13:38  phase1geo

	Adding new race condition checking diagnostics.  Updated all
	regression diagnostics that failed with new changes to remove race
	condition code.  Regression now runs cleanly will all race
	condition checking code.

	Added race1.1 to regression.  Removed unnecessary output statements
	from previous debugging checkins.

2005-01-24 07:21  phase1geo

	Modifying unlinking algorithm for statement links.  Still getting
	segmentation fault at this time.

	remove statement blocks from module when race conditions are found.

2005-01-10 07:47  phase1geo

	Adding race1 test into testsuite (though this is not part of the
	regression suite yet).	Updating CDD files for latest changes.

2005-01-10 07:44  phase1geo

	Fixing case where signal selects are being assigned by different
	statements that do not overlap.  We do not have race conditions in
	this case.

2005-01-09 20:59  phase1geo

	Code added for race condition checking that checks for signals
	being assigned in multiple statements.	Working on handling bit
	selects -- this is in progress.

2005-01-07 17:29  phase1geo

	Adding ability to handle strings in expressions.  Added string1.v
	diagnostic to verify this functionality.  Updated regressions for
	this change.

2005-01-07 16:59  phase1geo

	Regression now passes for previous changes.  Also added ability to
	properly convert quoted strings to vectors and vectors to quoted
	strings.  This will allow us to support strings in expressions. 
	This is a known good.

2005-01-07 11:59  phase1geo

	Finalized updates for supplemental field changes.  Everything
	compiles and links correctly at this time; however, a regression
	run has not confirmed the changes.

2005-01-06 17:51  phase1geo

	Intermediate checkin.  Files don't fully compile yet.

2005-01-06 08:32  phase1geo

	Starting to make updates to supplemental fields.  Work is in
	progress.

2005-01-04 08:37  phase1geo

	at this point.

2005-01-03 17:00  phase1geo

	Fixing library extension parser.

2005-01-03 16:24  phase1geo

	Fixing preprocessor to correctly ignore protected areas of code.

2005-01-03 16:02  phase1geo

	Fixing case where file is specified with -v after it has already
	been included to just ignore the file instead of printing out an
	incorrect error message that the file was unable to be opened.

2004-12-19 22:12  phase1geo

	A bit more race condition checking code added.	Still not there
	yet.

	Getting things ready for 20041209 development release.

2004-12-07 13:55  phase1geo

	Updating Makefiles to install GUI documentation images to correct
	directory.  Removing doc/Makefile as this is now generated via
	configure.

2004-12-07 07:52  phase1geo

	Updates to install user and GUI documentation.

2004-12-06 13:07  phase1geo

	Adding Makefile.am to GUI documentation directory.  Updated
	configure.in for this change.  We need to run autoconf (later
	version) to generate new configure.

	Fixing problem in expression_operate.  This removes some more code
	from the score command to improve run-time efficiency.

2004-11-06 07:22  phase1geo

	Updating CDD files for change where EVAL_T and EVAL_F bits are now
	being masked out of the CDD files.

2004-10-22 17:03  phase1geo

	More incremental changes to increase score command efficiency.

2004-10-22 16:40  phase1geo

	More incremental updates to improve efficiency in score command
	(though this change should not, in and of itself, improve
	efficiency).

2004-10-22 15:31  phase1geo

	Returning assignment status in vector_set_value and speeding up
	assignment procedure.  This is an incremental change to help speed
	up design scoring.

2004-10-08 07:31  phase1geo

	Documenting module/instance selection box.

2004-10-07 13:50  phase1geo

	Adding new images for main window documentation.  Updated all HTML
	main window files to include these images.

2004-10-06 23:28  phase1geo

	Adding more documentation for main window.  All files are now in
	place but many lack any real documentation.  Finished main window
	menu bar documentation at this point.

2004-10-06 00:04  phase1geo

	Updating documentation and adding new files.  Still a long way to
	go.

2004-10-04 08:36  phase1geo

	Adding missed file from last checkin.

2004-10-04 08:35  phase1geo

	finished at this point.

2004-09-15 11:29  phase1geo

	Correcting manual display to work properly with the -remote
	command.

2004-09-15 00:11  phase1geo

	Tcl/Tk libraries.

2004-09-11 00:20  phase1geo

	Updating configuration files and Makefiles to properly get Tcl/Tk
	compile/linking flags/information.  This methodology should be much
	more portable now.

2004-09-06 22:50  phase1geo

	Fixing bug with underlines going bezerk when switching between
	expressions.

2004-09-06 22:17  phase1geo

	Updates for upcoming 0.3 stable release.

2004-08-24 09:31  phase1geo

	Fixing horizontal pane in comb.tcl to work the way I want it to.

2004-08-23 23:47  phase1geo

	Fixing vertical pane so that left side remains constant (instead of
	relative to the size of the window) during resizing.

2004-08-23 14:06  phase1geo

	Code cleanup from last checkin.

2004-08-23 14:00  phase1geo

	Added handles to GUI for resizing subwindows.  This is now working.

2004-08-20 17:15  phase1geo

	Remaking About window and adding initial help support and
	adjustable panes.  Things are in limbo right now.

2004-08-20 10:08  phase1geo

	Various improvements/fixes to interface.

2004-08-18 01:16  phase1geo

	Cleaning up some GUI elements that didn't look right from before. 
	Things look and work pretty well at this point.

2004-08-17 10:23  phase1geo

	Added combinational logic coverage output to GUI.  Modified comb.c
	code to get this to work that impacts ASCII coverage output;
	however, regression is fully passing with these changes. 
	Combinational coverage for GUI is mostly complete regarding
	information and usability.  Possibly some cleanup in output and in
	code is needed.

2004-08-16 23:43  phase1geo

	Updating unary and binary combinational expression output functions
	to create string arrays instead of immediately sending the
	information to standard output to support GUI interface as well as
	ASCII interface.

2004-08-16 15:46  phase1geo

	Fixing problem where canceled file openings were acting badly. 
	Also added window and scrollbars for coverage information (although
	this information is not specified here yet).  Also added new global
	variable that reports the current expression to get coverage
	information for (this will be added next).  GUI is operating as
	desired and without errors at this point.

2004-08-16 13:54  phase1geo

	Fixing bugs in last checkin and added underline ID information to
	expression structure for recalling coverage information.

2004-08-16 12:28  phase1geo

	Combinational logic underlining is now working as currently wanted.
	 Able to move up and down underline tree correctly.

2004-08-16 00:07  phase1geo

	Adding more for displaying combinational logic underlines as
	desired.  Expressions are now (mostly) organized correctly.  Still
	need to determine which expression has been selected and need to
	display only expressions that are selected.

2004-08-13 17:05  phase1geo

	Work in progress on cleaning up combinational expression output.

2004-08-13 15:45  phase1geo

	More added for combinational logic verbose reporting.  At this
	point, the code is being output with underlines that can move up
	and down the expression tree.  No expression reporting is being
	done at this time, however.

2004-08-12 07:56  phase1geo

	Fixing error in combinational logic collection function for covered
	logic.

2004-08-11 17:11  phase1geo

	Initial beginnings of combinational logic verbose reporting to GUI.

2004-08-10 13:28  phase1geo

	Adding code to keep textbox output in main window the same when
	switching between different coverage types.

2004-08-10 12:23  phase1geo

	Fixing various user-related problems with interface.  Things are
	working pretty well at this point, I believe.

2004-08-10 10:58  phase1geo

	Fixing problems with toggle coverage when modules start on lines
	above 1 and problems when signal is a single or multi-bit select.

2004-08-10 09:28  phase1geo

	Removing diags and doc directories fro Makefile.am and fixing
	toggle.tcl to work as wanted.

	working exactly as it will be, but it is getting close.

2004-07-21 23:43  phase1geo

	Finishing code to calculate start and end columns of expressions. 
	Regression has been updated for these changes.	Other various minor
	changes as well.

2004-04-21 00:14  phase1geo

	Adding report_gui checking to print_output and adding error handler
	to TCL scripts.  Any errors occurring within the code will be
	propagated to the user.

2004-04-19 17:16  phase1geo

	Fixing syntax error from last change.

2004-04-19 08:42  phase1geo

	Forgot to modify replace function for column information.

2004-04-18 23:54  phase1geo

	Adding replace and merge options to file menu.

2004-04-07 06:36  phase1geo

	Changes made to allow opening multiple CDD files without needing to
	deallocate all memory for one before reallocating memory for
	another.  Things are not entirely working at this point.

2004-04-05 07:30  phase1geo

	Adding *db_replace functions to allow a design to be opened with
	new CDD results (for GUI purposes only).

2004-04-03 19:35  phase1geo

	Adding ability to hold place in textbox when switching
	background/foreground colors and coverage types.  Added labels
	above module/instance listbox and text box (removing "Line #" and
	"Verilog Source" from text window).  Making information label
	normal (not sunken) because the sunken affords user interaction.

2004-04-02 13:37  phase1geo

	Updating CVS 0_2_2 branch with changes since 0.2 release.  Also
	renaming signal to vsignal in release to fix bug where some OS's
	have a signal.h in the /usr/include directory that get compiled in
	with the unistd.h included by util.c.  This is the prelude to the
	0.2.3 stable release.  Updated NEWS.

2004-04-01 22:46  phase1geo

	Fixing message box for file opening.  This is now working
	correctly.  Added "Reopen CDD" command to File menu for future use.
	 Disabling "Open CDD..." command after file has been opened (since
	we cannot have more than one CDD file open currently).	Add message
	to info bar to tell user to select a module/instance name to see
	coverage results.

2004-04-01 16:54  phase1geo

	Making text field read-only.  Adding message when reading in new
	CDD files (as status information -- this is not working correctly
	yet).  Fixing bug in line.c when getting total lines summary
	information.

2004-04-01 06:44  phase1geo

	problems on systems that contain a signal type in the OS.

2004-03-29 16:47  phase1geo

	Causing module/instance listbox to not resize when window size is
	increased.  At some point we will want to figure out how to make
	this window resizable.

	location that is known to Covered without the use of a COVERED_HOME
	environment variable.  We are almost there now.

2004-03-22 07:26  phase1geo

	Updates for upcoming release.  We are not quite ready to release at
	this point.

2004-03-20 21:56  phase1geo

	Fixing combination_output_expr to work correctly for covered and
	uncovered modes.

2004-03-17 22:43  phase1geo

	cases.	Full regression runs clean with Icarus Verilog at this
	point.

2004-01-30 17:23  phase1geo

	More report output improvements.  Still not ready with regressions.

2004-01-30 00:04  phase1geo

	More report output format tweaks.  Adjusted lines and spaces to

2004-01-28 11:05  phase1geo

	Changing toggle report information from binary output format to
	hexidecimal output format for ease in readability for large signal

2004-01-27 07:34  phase1geo

	Working version of combinational logic report output but I still
	want to clean this code up.

2004-01-26 13:09  phase1geo

	Fixes to comb.c for last checkin.  We are not quite there yet with

	changes for comb.c should do the trick.

2004-01-25 23:39  phase1geo

	Initial swag at new underline ID algorithm.  This not quite working
	correctly at this time.  Added two generic diagnostics to
	regression suite that will test this new capability.

2004-01-24 21:40  phase1geo

	Fixes bugs in summary information not matching verbose information.
	 Also fixes bugs where instances were output when no logic was
	missing, where instance children were missing but not output. 
	Changed code to output summary information on a per instance basis
	(where children instances are not merged into parent instance
	summary information).  Updated regressions as a result.  Updates to

	displayed when verbose output was needed.  Updated regression for
	this change.  Also added new multi_exp diagnostics to verify
	multiple expression combination logic expressions in report output.
	 Full regression passes at this point.

2004-01-08 17:24  phase1geo

	Removing unnecessary scope information from signals, expressions

2003-12-19 17:08  phase1geo

	Adding initial version of expression report concatenation for more
	easily viewable/understandable reporting for combinational logic
	coverage.  This code is not yet completely set and debugged.

	for GUI.

2003-11-30 15:50  phase1geo

	Modifying line_collect_uncovered function to create array
	containing all physical lines (rather than just uncovered statement
	starting line values) for more accurate line coverage results for
	the GUI.  Added new long_exp2 diagnostic that is used to test this
	functionality.

2003-11-29 23:46  phase1geo

	at the top of tree.

2003-11-26 17:14  phase1geo

	Adding code to include left-hand-side expressions of statements for

	this diagnostic.

2003-11-11 16:41  phase1geo

	Fixing bug with reading VCD signals that are too long for Covered
	to support.  We were getting an assertion error when we should have
	simply read in and ignored the signal.

2003-11-11 15:48  phase1geo

	Fixing bug where next pointers in bind lists were not being
	initialized to NULL (manifested itself in Irix).  Also added
	missing development documentation to functions in fsm_var.c and
	removed unnecessary function.

2003-11-11 07:37  phase1geo

	Fixing bug in fsm_var that bound FSM statements early.	This caused
	an incorrect ordering of statements that results in incorrect FSM
	coverage.  Updated regression suite for changes.  Full regression
	now passes.

2003-11-09 22:25  phase1geo

	Adding more FSM diagnostics to regression suite.  All major testing
	for current FSM code should be complete at this time.  A few bug
	fixes to files that were found during this regression testing.

2003-11-07 22:21  phase1geo

	Adding several new FSM diagnostics to regression suite to verify

	by Icarus Verilog).

2002-10-30 00:07  phase1geo

	First attempt to handle expression trees/statement trees that
	contain unsupported code.  These are removed completely and not
	evaluated (because we can't guarantee that our results will match

	default values of constants and expression tree resizing has been
	optimized to its fullest.  Full regression has been updated and
	passes.  Adding new diagnostics to test suite.	Fixed a few
	problems in report outputting.

2002-10-02 13:55  phase1geo

	Cleaning things up a bit.

2002-09-25 00:36  phase1geo

	Initial version of parameter support is now in place.  Parameters
	work on a basic level.	param1.v tests this basic functionality and
	param1.cdd contains the correct CDD output from handling parameters
	in this file.  Yeah!

2002-09-24 21:51  phase1geo

	Removing need of vector nibble array allocation and deallocation
	during expression resizing for efficiency and bug reduction.  Other

	Need to make some changes to the inst_parm structure and some
	associated functionality for efficiency purposes.  This checkin
	contains most of the changes to the parser (with the exception of
	signal sizing).

2002-09-21 02:03  phase1geo

	expressions and signals before getting output to CDD file.

2002-09-20 23:11  phase1geo

	Completed phase 1 for adding in parameter support.  Main code is
	written that will create an instance parameter from a given module
	parameter in its entirety.  The next step will be to complete the
	module parameter creation code all the way to the parser. 
	Regression still passes and everything compiles at this point.

2002-09-19 18:51  phase1geo

	Separating VCS and Icarus Verilog regression runs to make running

	handling various cases where a statement is optional and doesn't
	exist.

2002-07-13 00:35  phase1geo

	Cause warning message to be displayed for a signal found in the VCD
	dumpfile that is in a covered scope but is not part of the design. 
	It could be that the design and VCD file do not match.

2002-07-13 00:23  phase1geo

	Major improvements to VCD scoping.  With these changes, Covered can
	read in a VCD file that contains scopes that are not used in the
	design, ignore unused scopes and use scopes that are found in its
	database.  Additionally, there was a major performance improvement
	for larger designs for VCD file reading (simulation time has
	improved).

2002-07-12 23:09  phase1geo

	Adding support for correct implementation of `ifdef, `else, `endif

	Updating all CDD files for change to constant value handling.

2002-07-09 22:01  phase1geo

	Added define1.v and define2.v diagnostics to regression suite. 
	Both diagnostics now pass.  Fixed cases where constants were not
	causing proper TRUE/FALSE values to be calculated.

2002-07-09 18:16  phase1geo

	Added defines2.v diagnostic to verify nested defines work properly.
	 Diagnostic passes.

2002-07-09 18:13  phase1geo

	always being built to having the option via the --with-mpatrol flag
	to the configure script.

2002-07-08 22:24  phase1geo

	Various fixes for module instantiantion handling.  This now works. 
	Also modified report output for toggle, line and combinational
	information.  Regression passes.

2002-07-08 22:23  phase1geo

	Modifying release.in to use command instead of file/directory
	names.

2002-07-05 11:49  phase1geo

	Modified a lot of code this go around.	Fixed VCD reader to handle
	changes in the reverse order (last changes are stored instead of
	first for timestamp).  Fixed problem with AEDGE operator to handle
	vector value changes correctly.  Added casez2.v diagnostic to
	verify proper handling of casez with '?' characters.  Full
	regression passes; however, the recent changes seem to have
	impacted performance -- need to look into this.

2002-07-05 00:01  phase1geo

	Removing unecessary debugging output.

2002-07-05 00:00  phase1geo

	Correcting case, casex and casez equality calculation to conform to
	correct equality check for each case type.  Verified that case
	statements work correctly at this point.  Added diagnostics to
	verify case statements.

2002-07-04 19:37  phase1geo

	Small update to CASE handling in scope to avoid future errors.

2002-07-04 19:10  phase1geo

	Adding report support for case statements.  Everything outputs
	fine; however, I want to remove CASE, CASEX and CASEZ expressions
	from being reported since it causes redundant and misleading
	information to be displayed in the verbose reports.  New
	diagnostics to check CASE expressions have been added and pass.

2002-07-04 18:10  phase1geo

	Added proper support for case, casex, and casez statements in score
	command.  Report command still incorrect for these statement types.

2002-07-04 13:19  phase1geo

	Updating Verilog lexer and parser to remove existing shift/reduce
	and reduce/reduce conflicts for good.  The current regression list

	lists.

2002-07-03 14:54  phase1geo

	Adding/fixing code to properly handle always blocks with the event
	control structures attached.  Added several new diagnostics to test
	this ability.  always1.v is still failing but the rest are passing.

2002-07-02 22:31  phase1geo

	Adding RCS Log strings in files that were missing them so that file
	version information is contained in every source and header file.

	Adding new diagnostic to verify all expressions in assign
	statements.

2002-07-01 10:14  phase1geo

	Adding CDD directory for comparing during regression.  The CDD
	files in the CDD directory match up with the Verilog diagnostic
	names.	The output from running regression are compared to these
	CDD files.  All CDD files in this directory are known to be good.

2002-07-01 10:12  phase1geo

	Updates to Makefile for regression purposes.  Still missing the
	automatic checking portion of the regression run.

2002-07-01 10:10  phase1geo

	Fixing always loopbacks and setting stop bits correctly.  All
	verilog diagnostics seem to be passing with these fixes.

2002-06-30 17:23  phase1geo

	Working on fixing looping in parser.  Statement connector needs to
	be revamped.

2002-06-28 23:51  phase1geo

	Various fixes for bugs found in regression testing.

2002-06-28 23:50  phase1geo

	Added new diagnostic to test always.  This diagnostic is not
	running properly yet do to missing code to handle CDD reading of
	cyclic statement trees.

2002-06-27 22:05  phase1geo

	Removing assign.v diagnostic from pool.  Updates to Makefile.

2002-06-27 22:04  phase1geo

	Removing unecessary output and updating regression Makefile.

2002-06-25 23:59  phase1geo

	Adding initial support for delays.  Support is not yet complete and
	is currently untested.

2002-06-25 22:45  phase1geo

	Fixing more bugs in simulator and report functions.  About to add
	support for delay statements.

2002-06-25 16:46  phase1geo

	Fixes to simulator and reporting.  Still some bugs here.

2002-06-25 07:48  phase1geo

	Fixing case where statement's true and false paths point to itself
	when reading in CDD.

2002-06-25 07:26  phase1geo

	Added unused types into parser.  These unused types mimic their
	"in-use" counterparts but are used in situations where we do not
	want to store its information for processing.  This removes the
	need to allocate and deallocate memory for unused logic.

2002-06-24 22:39  phase1geo

	Fixed initial scoring bugs.  We now generate a legal CDD file for
	reporting.  Fixed some report bugs though there are still some
	remaining.

2002-06-24 21:02  phase1geo

	Fixing bugs with writing/reading statements and with parsing design
	with statements.  We now get to the scoring section.  Some problems
	here at the moment with the simulator.

2002-06-24 07:34  phase1geo

	Still not there at this point.

2002-06-23 16:18  phase1geo

	Added appropriate statement support in parser.	All parts should be
	in place and ready to start testing.

2002-06-22 16:08  phase1geo

	Added simulation engine and tied it to the db.c file.  Simulation
	engine is currently untested and will remain so until the parser is
	updated correctly for statements.  This will be the next step.

2002-06-22 00:27  phase1geo

	Additional supporting code for simulation engine and statement
	support in parser.

2002-06-21 00:55  phase1geo

	Getting some codes ready for writing simulation engine.  We should
	be set now.

2002-06-18 21:25  phase1geo

	Moving documentation around.  Adding start of developer's
	documentation.

2002-06-01 00:22  phase1geo

	Adding files for user's document.  These are generated by the
	Manstyle utility.

2002-06-01 00:18  phase1geo

	Adding files created from the manstyle utility for creating user's
	manual.

2002-05-12 22:02  phase1geo

	Adding lines back to expressions and removing them from statements
	(since the line number range of an expression can be calculated by
	looking at the expression line numbers).

2002-05-02 22:39  phase1geo

	Removing all syntax errors due to addition of statements.  Added
	more statement support code.  Still have a ways to go before we can
	try anything.  Removed lines from expressions though we may want to
	consider putting these back for reporting purposes.

2002-05-01 22:27  phase1geo

	Initial creation of statement structure and manipulation files. 
	Internals are still in a chaotic state.

2002-04-30 00:04  phase1geo

	Added initial go-round of adding statement handling to parser. 
	Added simple Verilog test to check correct statement handling.	At
	this point there is a bug in the expression write function (we need
	to display statement trees in the proper order since they are
	unlike normal expression trees.)

2002-04-29 16:58  phase1geo

	Starting to add suggested statement expression support to run-time
	engine.  This is not completed yet at this point.

2002-04-28 21:42  phase1geo

	Starting to add support for statements.  Added support for bit-wise
	coverage for combinational coverage instead of requiring a 1-bit
	expression to be measurable.  Not turned on at this point in the
	reporting, but is present in the scoring engine.

2002-04-27 00:04  phase1geo

	Fixing bugs 548895 and 549311.	Also added rest of initial support
	for combinational logic verbose reporting.  Works for small set of
	examples.

2002-04-25 21:21  phase1geo

	Making VCD parser more verbose to handle VCD syntax that Icarus
	Verilog doesn't generate but other VCD outputs do.  Also fixing bug
	with underlining output.

2002-04-25 08:35  phase1geo

	Fixing bug that allowed a parent expression to only be one bit wide
	when its children were larger.	Other subtle fixes with report
	output.

2002-04-24 22:37  phase1geo

	Removed op field from expression structure and moved it to the
	supplemental field in the structure.  This lessens the memory
	required for an expression by 4 bytes.	Updated all code
	accordingly and regenerated automatic documentation.

2002-04-23 11:15  phase1geo

	Removing unused files

2002-04-23 10:03  phase1geo

	Removing Makefile from CVS repository in src directory.  Fixing
	percent sign output for summary reporting.

2002-04-23 00:27  phase1geo

	Finished first go-round with the combinational logic verbose
	output.  Still a few bugs and quite a bit of missing functionality
	in this area.

2002-04-22 20:22  phase1geo

	Cleaning up the output for line, toggle and combinational
	reporting.  Fixed bug in toggle verbose function where hit01 and
	hit10 were not getting cleared before being set in the
	vector_toggle_count function which kept untoggled signals from
	being output on the verbose report.

2002-04-22 20:04  phase1geo

	Fixed initial bugs in underlining code.  This seems to be working
	correctly at this point.

2002-04-22 08:31  phase1geo

	Started to fix some bugs in the underline code.  Not finished with
	the bug fixes at this time.

2002-04-22 00:00  phase1geo

	Modified assign diagnostic to change coverage results.	Added check
	for TRUE/FALSE of expression for proper underlining.

2002-04-21 23:46  phase1geo

	Adding initial code for combination verbose output.  This code is
	not fully debugged and is missing some important features at this
	point.

2002-04-20 00:55  phase1geo
