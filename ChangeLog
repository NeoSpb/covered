	More work on instrumenting Verilog code.  Added statement iterator
	and fixed a few issues with the code.  Checkpointing.

2008-11-29 22:16  phase1geo

	Adding bit to save off parenthesis existence from original Verilog
	source.  Updating regression per these changes.

2008-11-28 22:27  phase1geo

	More work on inlined coverage code insertion.  Net assigns and
	procedural assigns seem to be working at a most basic level. 
	Currently, I have an issue that I need to solve where non-head
	statements are being ignored.  Checkpointing.

2008-11-26 18:24  phase1geo

	Fixing problems with previous version of generator.  Things work as
	expected at this point.  Checkpointing.

2008-11-26 18:01  phase1geo

	More work on coverage generator.  Checkpointing.

2008-11-25 23:34  phase1geo

	More work on Verilog generator file.  We are now able to create the
	needed directories and output a non-instrumented version of a
	module to the appropriate directory.  Checkpointing.

2008-11-25 17:53  phase1geo

	Adding files for Verilog generator functions.
