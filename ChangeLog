	Separating debugging and profiling so that we can do profiling
	without all of the debug overhead.

2007-12-12 01:23  phase1geo

	More work on profiling.  I have now included the ability to get
	function runtimes.  Still more work to do but everything is
	currently working at the moment.

2007-12-11 17:19  phase1geo

	Fixed compile issues and completed first pass injection of
	profiling calls.  Working on ordering the calls from most to least.

	again (next submission should do it).

2007-12-10 17:16  phase1geo

	code for handling struct/union declarations.  Code compiles thus
	far.

2007-09-13 17:50  phase1geo

	Initial creation of struct_union files.  Added initial parsing
	ability for structs and unions (though I don't believe this is
	complete at this time).

2007-09-13 12:03  phase1geo

	Cleaning up some const-ness corrections -- still more to go but
	it's a good start.

2007-09-12 10:27  phase1geo

	regressions to fully pass.

2007-09-12 00:40  phase1geo

	Adding support for bool and char types in FOR loop initialization
	blocks.  Adding a plethora of new diagnostics to completely verify
	this new functionality.  These new diagnostics have not been run
	yet so they will fail in the next run of regression but should be
	ready to be checked out.

2007-09-11 17:39  phase1geo

	Updating TODO.

2007-09-11 17:38  phase1geo

	suite -- in the process of running full regressions with this
	change.

2007-09-11 00:01  phase1geo

	Updating parser to handle embedded type information and consecutive
	data assignments in initialization block of FOR loop (not added for
	generate for blocks yet, however).  Fixed a few other parser
	compile errors.

	Fixing compile errors.	Added for5 diagnostic for preparation for
	feature addition.

2007-09-08 00:15  phase1geo

	Cleaning up parser2.y (much more work to do here yet).

2007-09-07 17:36  phase1geo

	Completed first pass of new parser.  Still encountering some bison
	errors with the original syntax, but this includes the entire
	normative.

2007-09-07 00:39  phase1geo

	More parser updates to support SystemVerilog BNF.

2007-09-06 17:53  phase1geo

	Starting to create new parser that is fully SystemVerilog
	compliant.  This represents only the beginning of this work.
