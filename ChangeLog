	* Updating regression for latest version of Icarus Verilog.

2007-07-18 17:39  phase1geo

	* Checkpointing generate work though we are at a fairly broken
	  state at the moment.

2007-07-17 21:15  phase1geo

	* Attempts to fix a problem with generating instances with
	  hierarchy.  Also fixing an issue with named blocks in generate
	  statements.  Still some work to go before regressions are passing
	  again, however.

2007-07-17 09:19  phase1geo

	* Updating VCS regression files.  VCS regressions do not fully
	  complete successfully at this point, however.

2007-07-17 07:52  phase1geo

	* Updating TODO list.

2007-07-16 17:24  phase1geo

	* Fixed bugs in accumulated coverage output and updated regression
	  files for this change.  VCS simulated results are not contained
	  here, however.

2007-07-16 13:39  phase1geo

	* Finishing adding accumulated coverage output to report files.
	  Also fixed compiler warnings with static values in C code that
	  are inputs to 64-bit variables.  Full regression was not run with
	  these changes due to pre-existing simulator problems in core
	  code.

2007-07-16 07:39  phase1geo

	* Started to add support for displaying accumulated coverage
	  results for each metric.  Finished line and toggle and am
	  half-way done with memory coverage (still have combinational
	  logic, FSM and assertion coverage to complete before this feature
	  is fully functional).

2007-04-20 17:56  phase1geo

	* More regression updates and simulator core fixes.  Still a ways
	  to go.

2007-04-19 07:43  phase1geo

	* Adding concat7 to the test and regression suite.  This diagnostic
	  currently fails.

2007-04-18 17:34  phase1geo

	* Revamping simulator core again.  Checkpointing.

2007-04-17 11:31  phase1geo

	* Fixing bug 1698806 by rebinding a parameter signal to its list of
	  expressions prior to writing the initial CDD file (elaboration
	  phase).  Added param16 diagnostic to regression suite to verify
	  the fix.  Full regressions pass.

2007-04-13 16:47  phase1geo

	* More simulation debugging.  Added 'display all_list' command to
	  CLI to output the list of all threads.  Updated regressions
	  though we are not fully passing at the moment.  Checkpointing.

2007-04-12 16:35  phase1geo

	* More bug fixes to simulation core.  Checkpointing.

2007-04-12 15:54  phase1geo

	* Adding cli > output when replaying and adding back all of the
	  functions (since the cli > prompt helps give it context.  Fixing
	  bugs in simulation core.  Checkpointing.

2007-04-12 09:28  phase1geo

	* Adding ability to display the last <num> lines of history to the
	  history command.  Changed behavior of 'display active_queue' and
	  'display delayed_queue' commands to output when replaying
	  history.  Also modified look of the help output to hopefully make
	  it easier to read.

2007-04-11 23:15  phase1geo

	* Adding history all command, added list command and updated the
	  display current command to include statement output.

2007-04-11 22:46  phase1geo

	* Fixing bugs with CLI.  History and history file saving/loading is
	  implemented and working as desired.

2007-04-11 17:29  phase1geo

	* Adding support for CLI to score command.  Still some work to go
	  to get history stuff right.  Otherwise, it seems to be working.

2007-04-10 22:15  phase1geo

	* Attempting to fix delay expression for new simulation core.
	  Almost there.

2007-04-10 22:04  phase1geo

	* Fixing bug 1688487.

2007-04-10 22:03  phase1geo

	* Fixing writability check to -o option in the score command.
	  Fixes bug 1688487.

2007-04-10 17:10  phase1geo

	* Fixing some more simulation issues.

2007-04-09 22:56  phase1geo

	* Completing majority of code to support new simulation core.
	  Starting to debug this though we still have quite a ways to go
	  here.  Checkpointing.

2007-04-09 17:47  phase1geo

	* Starting to modify the simulation engine for performance
	  purposes.  Code is not complete and is untested at this point.

2007-04-03 13:55  phase1geo

	* Fixing more bugs in reporting mechanisms for unnamed scopes.
	  Checking in more regression updates per these changes.
	  Checkpointing.

2007-04-02 23:15  phase1geo

	* Fixing bugs in func_iter functionality.  Modified functional unit
	  name flattening function (though this does not appear to be
	  working correctly at this time).  Added calls to
	  funit_flatten_name in all of the reporting files.  Checkpointing.

2007-04-02 15:19  phase1geo

	* Checkpointing more work on use of functional iterators.  Not
	  working correctly yet.

2007-04-01 23:50  phase1geo

	* Adding func_iter files to iterate through a functional unit for
	  reporting purposes.  Updated affected files.

2007-03-30 17:43  phase1geo

	* Regression fixes.  Still have a ways to go but we are getting
	  close.

2007-03-28 13:46  phase1geo

	* Adding TODO item to make all C code splint clean.
