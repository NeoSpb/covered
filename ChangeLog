	configure with this change to properly support reading in files
	larger than 2GB.

2007-07-31 17:17  phase1geo

	Attempting to debug issue with automatic static functions.  Updated
	regressions per last change.

2007-07-31 15:06  phase1geo

	Finished work on automatic function support and added new
	static_afunc1 diagnostic to verify static use of automatic
	functions (this diagnostic is currently not passing).

2007-07-30 22:36  phase1geo

	Fixing last known issue with automatic functions.  Also fixing
	issue with toggle report output (still a problem with the toggle
	calculation for the return value of the function).

2007-07-30 17:42  phase1geo

	Making some progress on automatic function support.  Things
	currently don't compile but I need to checkpoint for now.

2007-07-30 15:36  phase1geo

	Fixing rest of issues pertaining to new implementation of function
	calls.	Full regression passes (with the exception of afunc1 which
	we do not expect to pass with these changes as of yet).

2007-07-28 22:32  phase1geo

	First attempt to make FUNC_CALL expressions copy the functional
	return value to the expression vector.	Not quite working yet --
	checkpointing.

2007-07-27 17:43  phase1geo

	Starting to add support for saving expression information for
	re-entrant tasks/functions.  Still more work to go.

2007-07-27 17:26  phase1geo

	Regression updates from latest change.

2007-07-27 16:57  phase1geo

	Adding afunc1 diagnostic to regression suite (though this
	diagnostic does not currently pass).  Checkpointing.

2007-07-27 14:11  phase1geo

	Putting in rest of support for automatic functions/tasks.  Checked
	in atask1 diagnostic files.

2007-07-26 17:23  phase1geo

	Starting to work on the functionality for automatic
	tasks/functions.  Just checkpointing some work.

2007-07-26 15:12  phase1geo

	Fixing bug related to failure of hier1.1 diagnostic.  Placing
	functional unit scope in quotes for cases where backslashes are
	used in the scope names (requiring spaces in the names to escape
	the backslash).  Incrementing CDD version and regenerated all
	regression files.  Only atask1 is currently failing in regressions
	now.

2007-07-26 15:08  phase1geo

2007-07-26 12:05  phase1geo

	Fixing problem with static functions (vector data associated with
	expressions were not being allocated).	Regressions have been run. 
	Only two failures in total still to be fixed.

2007-07-26 00:03  phase1geo

	Starting to work on fix for static function support.  Fixing issue
	if func_call is called with NULL thr parameter (to avoid
	segmentation fault).  IV regression fully passes.

2007-07-24 17:52  phase1geo

	More clean-up for VCS regressions.  Still not fully passing yet.

2007-07-23 07:32  phase1geo

	at the moment.

2007-07-17 21:15  phase1geo

	Attempts to fix a problem with generating instances with hierarchy.
	 Also fixing an issue with named blocks in generate statements. 
	Still some work to go before regressions are passing again,
	however.

2007-07-17 09:19  phase1geo

	Updating VCS regression files.	VCS regressions do not fully
	complete successfully at this point, however.

2007-07-17 07:52  phase1geo

	Updating TODO list.

2007-07-16 17:24  phase1geo

	Fixed bugs in accumulated coverage output and updated regression
	files for this change.	VCS simulated results are not contained
	here, however.

2007-07-16 13:39  phase1geo

	Finishing adding accumulated coverage output to report files.  Also
	fixed compiler warnings with static values in C code that are
	inputs to 64-bit variables.  Full regression was not run with these
	changes due to pre-existing simulator problems in core code.

2007-07-16 07:39  phase1geo

	Started to add support for displaying accumulated coverage results
	for each metric.  Finished line and toggle and am half-way done
	with memory coverage (still have combinational logic, FSM and
	assertion coverage to complete before this feature is fully
	functional).

2007-04-20 17:56  phase1geo

	More regression updates and simulator core fixes.  Still a ways to
	go.

	More simulation debugging.  Added 'display all_list' command to CLI
	to output the list of all threads.  Updated regressions though we
	are not fully passing at the moment.  Checkpointing.

2007-04-12 16:35  phase1geo

	More bug fixes to simulation core.  Checkpointing.

2007-04-12 15:54  phase1geo

	Adding cli > output when replaying and adding back all of the
	functions (since the cli > prompt helps give it context.  Fixing
	bugs in simulation core.  Checkpointing.

2007-04-12 09:28  phase1geo

	Adding ability to display the last <num> lines of history to the
	history command.  Changed behavior of 'display active_queue' and
	'display delayed_queue' commands to output when replaying history. 
	Also modified look of the help output to hopefully make it easier
	to read.

2007-04-11 23:15  phase1geo

	Adding history all command, added list command and updated the
	display current command to include statement output.

2007-04-11 22:46  phase1geo

	Fixing bugs with CLI.  History and history file saving/loading is
	implemented and working as desired.

2007-04-11 17:29  phase1geo

	Adding support for CLI to score command.  Still some work to go to
	get history stuff right.  Otherwise, it seems to be working.

2007-04-10 22:15  phase1geo

	Attempting to fix delay expression for new simulation core.  Almost
	there.

	Starting to debug this though we still have quite a ways to go
	here.  Checkpointing.

2007-04-09 17:47  phase1geo

	Starting to modify the simulation engine for performance purposes. 
	Code is not complete and is untested at this point.

2007-04-03 13:55  phase1geo

	Fixing more bugs in reporting mechanisms for unnamed scopes. 
	Checking in more regression updates per these changes. 
	Checkpointing.

2007-04-02 23:15  phase1geo

	Fixing bugs in func_iter functionality.  Modified functional unit
	name flattening function (though this does not appear to be working
	correctly at this time).  Added calls to funit_flatten_name in all
	of the reporting files.  Checkpointing.

2007-04-02 15:19  phase1geo

	Checkpointing more work on use of functional iterators.  Not
	working correctly yet.

2007-04-01 23:50  phase1geo

	Adding func_iter files to iterate through a functional unit for
	reporting purposes.  Updated affected files.

2007-03-30 17:43  phase1geo

	Regression fixes.  Still have a ways to go but we are getting
	close.

2007-03-28 13:46  phase1geo

	Adding TODO item to make all C code splint clean.
