	Fixing figure numbering in comb.html file.

2006-03-29 12:06  phase1geo

	More GUI documentation updates.  This should do it for the updates
	for now.  We just need to run the autoreconf and automake tools.

2006-03-28 17:04  phase1geo

	More updates.

2006-03-28 16:29  phase1geo

	Missed the Makefile in the doc/user/test directory from the last
	submission.

2006-03-28 16:28  phase1geo

	source file in the src directory.  Added test directory in user
	documentation directory containing the example used in line,
	toggle, combinational logic and FSM descriptions.

2006-03-27 23:03  phase1geo

	Updating man page and configuration files for stable 0.4 release.

	passes.

2006-03-27 11:37  phase1geo

	Fixing race condition output.  Some regressions may fail due to
	these changes.

2006-03-24 13:01  phase1geo

	Changed two variable report output to be as concise as possible. 
	Updating regressions per these changes.

2006-03-23 16:42  phase1geo

	Changed two variable combinational expressions that have a constant
	value in either the left or right expression tree to unary
	expressions.  Removed expressions containing only static values
	from coverage totals.  Fixed bug in stmt_iter_get_next_in_order for
	looping cases (the verbose output was not being emitted for these
	cases).  Updated regressions for these changes -- full regression
	passes.

2006-03-23 11:09  phase1geo

	Updating files from regression runs.  Full regression now passes.

2006-03-22 16:00  phase1geo

	Fixing bug in missed combinational logic determination where a
	static expression on the left/right of a combination expression
	should cause the entire expression to be considered fully covered. 
	Regressions have not been run which may contain some miscompares
	due to this change.

2006-03-22 15:34  phase1geo

	Fixing code generation bug.

2006-03-22 15:20  phase1geo

	Updating run program.  Fixing bugs in statement_connect algorithm. 
	Updating regression files.

2006-03-13 15:10  phase1geo

	statement reconnection algorithm.

2006-03-06 16:55  phase1geo

	Fixing command-line parser.

2006-03-03 17:24  phase1geo

	Fixing C-based run script.  This is now working for all but one
	diagnostic to this point.  There is still some work to do here,
	however.

2006-02-27 17:22  phase1geo

	Working on C-version of run command.  Initial version only -- does
	not work at this point.

2006-02-24 15:14  phase1geo

	Updating most of the diagnostics for the new regression running
	style.	All IV tests have been proved to pass, running both the old
	and the new styles.

2006-02-22 17:32  phase1geo

	More fixes to regression scripts.

2006-02-22 12:48  phase1geo

	the creation of a new diagnostic from scratch using the convert and
	Makefile scripts.

2006-02-22 12:33  phase1geo

	Adding Makefile that will manage converting over files and creating
	new ones.

	Adding diagnostic type information to make conversion more correct.

2006-02-22 10:39  phase1geo

	More fixes to run script and convert script.  Things are working
	properly at this time now.

2006-02-21 22:23  phase1geo

	Initial start to diagnostic conversion script.	This seems to be
	working but needs more testing (and possibly some more smarts).

2006-02-21 17:32  phase1geo

	Adding add1.v diagnostic for example purposes.

2006-02-21 17:26  phase1geo

	Working on regression script.  This now works for the add1.v
	example.

	release.

2006-02-18 00:26  phase1geo

	Final file updates prior to covered-20060218 development release.

2006-02-17 17:19  phase1geo

	More updates to run script -- this is still not working exactly the
	way that I would like it to but I may need to rethink the
	diagnostic header stuff more.

2006-02-17 13:50  phase1geo

	Added full support for escaped names.  Full regression passes.

2006-02-16 15:19  phase1geo

	Adding support for arrays of instances.  Also fixing some memory
	problems for constant functions and fixed binding problems when
	hierarchical references are made to merged modules.  Full
	regression now passes.

2006-02-15 23:33  phase1geo

	More additions to regression script.  Need to do lots of debugging.
	 add1.v diagnostic contains initial support for new regression
	style.

2006-02-13 10:19  phase1geo

	Code cleanup.

2006-02-13 09:42  phase1geo

	Adding support for NULL expressions in parameter override
	expression lists.  In VCS, this simply skips overriding the Nth
	parameter -- Covered does the same.  Full regression now passes.

2006-02-13 08:23  phase1geo

	Started work on Perl run script for regressions and single
	diagnostic runs.

2006-02-10 16:10  phase1geo

	regression suite to verify its implementation.	Updated TODO.  Full
	regression passes at this point.

2006-02-10 00:57  phase1geo

	Final updates to GUI documentation and images for current GUI.	All
	GUI documentation has been verified to install correctly and
	accurately reflects the current state of the GUI.  Whew!  Updated
	TODO.  Cleaned up a bunch of unused GUI documentation files and
	images.

2006-02-09 21:08  phase1geo

	More fixes to navigational buttons and adding functionality to
	"Show current selection" menu item in view menu.  Now everything
	seems to be working as wanted.	We should now be ready to finish
	the GUI documentation.

2006-02-09 17:23  phase1geo

	Fixing more GUI bugs.  Added navigational menu items and put in
	functional support for this navigation.  Things seem to be working
	now for the most part.

2006-02-09 08:23  phase1geo

	Adding next and previous buttons to combinational logic detail
	window.  Functionality not complete at this time.

2006-02-08 17:34  phase1geo

	Lots of enhancements and bug fixes to GUI.  Added next and previous
	buttons in main window for finding uncovered metrics quickly
	(although there is no functionality to these buttons currently).

2006-02-08 07:54  phase1geo

	Adding previous and next buttons to toggle window.  Added currently
	selected cursor output to main textbox with associated
	functionality.

2006-02-07 21:57  phase1geo

	Adding new signed diagnostics to test >, <, >=, <=, == and !=
	operations on signed values.  Full regression passes at this point.

2006-02-06 16:48  phase1geo

	Several enhancements to GUI look and feel.  Fixed error in
	combinational logic window.

2006-02-06 09:35  phase1geo

	Fixing bug with -f option when the file is empty (previously
	segfaulted).

2006-02-05 23:10  phase1geo

	Adding *.png files for GUI documentation.

2006-02-05 23:07  phase1geo

	Fixed expression_set_static_only function to consider static
	expressions properly.  Updated regression as a result of this
	change.  Added files for signed3 diagnostic.  Documentation updates
	for GUI (these are not quite complete at this time yet).

2006-02-03 17:49  phase1geo

	More fixes to support signed comparison and propagation.  Still
	more testing to do here before I call it good.	Regression may fail
	at this point.

2006-02-02 21:11  phase1geo

	Fixing errors in GUI display of combinational logic coverage.  I
	still see a few problems here that need to be taken care of,
	however.

2006-02-02 16:36  phase1geo

	Starting to put in support for signed values and inline register
	initialization.  Also added support for more attribute locations in
	code.  Regression updated for these changes.  Interestingly, with
	the changes that were made to the parser, signals are output to
	reports in order (before they were completely reversed).  This is a
	nice surprise...  Full regression passes.

2006-02-01 23:42  phase1geo

	Adding missing documentation and image files from last checkin.

2006-02-01 23:40  phase1geo

	Several documentation updates as well as added help buttons to
	preferences and summary windows.

	Adding more diagnostics to regression suite.  Full regression
	passes.

2006-02-01 13:58  phase1geo

	More updates to allow parsing of various parameter formats.  At
	this point I believe full parameter support is functional. 
	Regression has been updated which now completely passes.  A few new
	diagnostics have been added to the testsuite to verify additional
	functionality that is supported.

2006-02-01 09:13  phase1geo

	Added support for handling bit selections in RHS parameter
	calculations.  New mbit_sel5.4 diagnostic added to verify this
	change.  Added the start of a regression utility that will
	eventually replace the old Makefile system.

2006-01-31 10:40  phase1geo

	Adding initial support and diagnostics for the variable multi-bit
	select operators +: and -:.  More to come but full regression
	passes.

2006-01-30 00:03  phase1geo

	Documentation updates for LXT dumpfile option and Verilog-2001
	supported constructs.

2006-01-28 00:42  phase1geo

	Added configuration read/write functionality for tool preferences
	and integrated the preferences.tcl file into Covered's GUI.  This
	is now functioning correctly.

2006-01-27 21:04  phase1geo

	Updating Makefile.in in scripts directory to include the
	preferences.tcl file.

2006-01-27 17:46  phase1geo

	Adding initial preferences window.  Looks good at this point but we
	still need to properly tie this into the main program.

2006-01-27 09:43  phase1geo

	Added ifdefs for HAVE_ZLIB define to allow Covered to compile
	correctly when zlib.h and associated library is unavailable.  Also
	handle dumpfile reading appropriately for this condition.  Moved
	report file opening after the CDD file has been read in to avoid
	empty report files when a problem is detected in the CDD file.

2006-01-27 08:19  phase1geo

	Updating configuration files.

2006-01-26 17:43  phase1geo

	Fixing coredump problem when we have a problem reading the LXT
	file.

2006-01-26 17:20  phase1geo

	Reworking diagnostic Makefiles to include the ability to test LXT
	support in regressions.

2006-01-26 16:40  phase1geo

	Fixing last LXT bug.

2006-01-26 11:34  phase1geo

	Finished work on lxt2_read.c and fixed bug in LXT-based simulator. 
	Also adding missing lxt.h header file.

2006-01-26 00:07  phase1geo

	Build updates.

2006-01-26 00:06  phase1geo

	Starting to work on formatting the lxt2_read file and improving
	error output to conform to Covered's error-reporting mechanism.

2006-01-25 16:48  phase1geo

	Updating TODO status.

2006-01-25 16:13  phase1geo

	Adding LXT-style dumpfile parsing support.  Everything is wired in
	but I still need to look at a problem at the end of the dumpfile --
	I'm getting coredumps when using the new -lxt option.  I also need
	to disable LXT code if the z library is missing along with
	documenting the new feature in the user's guide and man page.

2006-01-25 10:51  phase1geo

	Fixing performance/output issue with hierarchical references. 
	Added support for hierarchical references to parser.  Full
	regression passes.

2006-01-24 22:33  phase1geo

	Updating TODO.

2006-01-24 22:32  phase1geo

	Fixing bug with latest checkins.  Full regression is now passing
	for IV simulated diagnostics.

2006-01-24 17:33  phase1geo

	A few cleanups.

2006-01-24 17:24  phase1geo

	More updates to handle static functions properly.  I have redone
	quite a bit of code here which has regressions pretty broke at the
	moment.  More work to do but I'm checkpointing.

2006-01-23 16:57  phase1geo

	Updating TODO file.

2006-01-23 16:55  phase1geo

	Updates to fix constant function support.  There is some issues to
	resolve here but full regression is passing with the exception of
	the newly added static_func1.1 diagnostic.  Fixed problem where
	expand and multi-bit expressions were getting coverage numbers
	calculated for them before they were simulated.

2006-01-23 11:23  phase1geo

	Fixing scope issues that came up when port assignment was added. 
	Full regression now passes.

2006-01-22 21:53  phase1geo

	Adding support for input/output ports of tasks/functions. 
	Regressions are not running cleanly at this point so there is still
	some work to do here.  Checkpointing.

2006-01-20 16:50  phase1geo

	Code cleanup.

2006-01-20 16:44  phase1geo

	Moving parameter resolution to post-bind stage to allow static
	functions to be considered.  Regression passes without static
	function testing.  Static function support still has some work to
	go.  Checkpointing.

2006-01-20 13:27  phase1geo

	Fixing compile warning.

2006-01-20 13:15  phase1geo

	Fixed bug to properly handle the scoping of parameters when
	parameters are created/used in non-module functional units.  Added
	param10*.v diagnostics to regression suite to verify the behavior
	is correct now.

2006-01-19 23:52  phase1geo

	Adding new diagnostic to test suite to test parameter usage
	situation that has not been tested to this point.

2006-01-19 17:29  phase1geo

	Fixing bug from last checkin in tcl_funcs.c (infinite looping). 
	Small updates to menu.

2006-01-19 17:08  phase1geo

	Adding line and starting column information to vsignal structure
	(and associated CDD files).  Regression has been fully updated for
	this change which now fully passes.  Final changes to summary GUI. 
	Fixed signal underlining for toggle coverage to work for both
	explicit and implicit signals.	Getting things ready for a
	preferences window.

2006-01-18 18:01  phase1geo

	Lots of changes/additions.  Summary report window work is now
	complete (with the exception of adding extra features).  Added
	support for parsing left and right shift operators and the exponent
	operator in static expression scenarios.  Fixed issues related to
	GUI (due to recent changes in the score command).  Things seem to
	be generally working as expected with the GUI now.

2006-01-17 23:39  phase1geo

	More updates to summary.tcl.  Still not there yet.

2006-01-17 17:38  phase1geo

	Adding very beginning of a summary window.  This is totally
	incomplete at this point.

2006-01-17 17:08  phase1geo

	Updating VCS version of regression per last weeks changes.  Full
	regression now passes.

2006-01-16 12:10  phase1geo

	Causing all error information to get sent to stderr no matter what
	mode we are in.  Updating error diagnostics for this change.  Full
	regression now passes.

2006-01-16 11:27  phase1geo

	Fixing binding issues when designs have modules/tasks/functions
	that are either used more than once in a design or have the same
	name.  Full regression now passes.

2006-01-13 22:17  phase1geo

	Adding is_func_unit function to check to see if a -e value is a
	valid module, function, task or named begin/end block.	Updated
	regression accordingly.  We are getting closer but still have a few
	diagnostics to figure out yet.

2006-01-13 17:27  phase1geo

	Initial attempt to fix problem with handling functions/tasks/named
	blocks with the same name in the design.  Still have a few
	diagnostics failing in regressions to contend with.  Updating
	regression with these changes.

2006-01-13 07:42  phase1geo

	Added task4 diagnostic to recreate bug found in the field.

2006-01-12 22:01  phase1geo

	Adding support for exponential operation.  Added exponent1
	diagnostic to verify but Icarus does not support this currently.

2006-01-12 17:14  phase1geo

	Added test to verify defparam overridding of localparams cannot
	occur.	Updated TODO file to list which Verilog-2001 constructs are
	currently supported.  Full regression passes.

2006-01-12 16:52  phase1geo

	Adding support for localparam construct.  Added tests to regression
	suite to verify correct functionality.	Full regression passes.

2006-01-12 16:14  phase1geo

	Completed code for handling parameter value pass by name
	Verilog-2001 syntax.  Added diagnostics to regression suite and
	updated regression files for this change.  Full regression now
	passes.

2006-01-11 13:57  phase1geo

	Added diagnostics to verify proper handling of inline parameters,
	inline port declarations and added is_signed bit to vector
	supplemental field (though we still do not handle signed values
	appropriately).

2006-01-11 13:50  phase1geo

	Added diagnostics to verify proper handling of inline parameters,
	inline port declarations and added is_signed bit to vector
	supplemental field (though we still do not handle signed values
	appropriately).

2006-01-10 23:38  phase1geo

	Fixing Verilog-2001 inline port declaration.  This now seems to be
	working properly.  Started adding support for register assignment
	to inline port declaration -- not finished yet but can parse.

2006-01-10 17:13  phase1geo

	Completed support for implicit event sensitivity list.	Added
	diagnostics to verify this new capability.  Also started support
	for parsing inline parameters and port declarations (though this is
	probably not complete and not passing at this point). 
	Checkpointing.

2006-01-09 23:56  phase1geo

	In the middle of adding support for event sensitivity lists to
	score command.	Regressions should pass but this code is not
	complete at this time.

2006-01-09 23:18  phase1geo

	Adding ashift2 diagnostic to regression suite to verify report
	output of arithmetic shift operations.

2006-01-09 23:12  phase1geo

	diagnostic to verify their correct operation.

2006-01-09 13:00  phase1geo

	Updating NEWS file for cleanup function adds.

2006-01-09 12:58  phase1geo

	Updating regression for VCS runs.  Added cleanup function at exit
	to remove the tmp* file (if it exists) regardless of the internal
	state of Covered at the time of exit (removes the need for the user
	to remove this file when things go awry).  Documentation updates
	for this feature.

2006-01-09 00:11  phase1geo

	Adding -S option documentation to man page for score command.

2006-01-09 00:08  phase1geo

	More documentation updates for release dates.

2006-01-09 00:01  phase1geo

	Updating NEWS for the next release.

2006-01-08 23:20  phase1geo

	Updates for next development release of Covered.  Still need to run
	vcs regression and update these files before we can fully release.

2006-01-08 22:52  phase1geo

	Updating regression.  Full regression now passes.

2006-01-08 22:15  phase1geo

	Attempting to fix one last problem with latest changes.  Regression
	runs are currently running.  Checkpointing.

2006-01-07 23:51  phase1geo

	Added optimizations to EOR and AEDGE expressions.  In the process
	of running regressions...

2006-01-07 21:05  phase1geo

	Checkpointing work on optimized thread handling.  I believe that
	this is now working as wanted; however, regressions will not pass
	until EOR optimization has been completed.  I will be working on
	this next.

2006-01-06 17:39  phase1geo

	Started working on removing the need to simulate more than is
	necessary.  Things are pretty broken at this point, but all of the
	code should be in -- debugging.

2006-01-06 12:54  phase1geo

	Breaking up expression_operate function into individual functions
	for each expression operation.	Also storing additional information
	in a globally accessible, constant structure array to increase
	performance.  Updating full regression for these changes.  Full
	regression passes.

2006-01-04 23:56  phase1geo

	Updated TODO.

2006-01-04 23:52  phase1geo

	Removing wait bit in vector supplemental field and modifying
	algorithm to only assign in the post-sim location (pre-sim now is
	gone).	This fixes some issues with simulation results and
	increases performance a bit.  Updated regressions for these
	changes.  Full regression passes.

2006-01-04 16:07  phase1geo

	Changing expression execution calculation from sim to
	expression_operate function.  Updating all regression files for
	this change.  Modifications to diagnostic Makefile to accommodate
	environments that do not have valgrind.

2006-01-03 21:15  phase1geo

	Adding bassign3 diagnostic to regression suite to verify
	expression_assign function works correctly for CONCAT/LIST
	ordering.

2006-01-03 17:00  phase1geo

	Removing debugging output from last checkin.

2006-01-03 16:59  phase1geo

	Fixing bug in expression_assign function -- removed recursive
	assignment when the LHS expression is a signal, single-bit,
	multi-bit or static value (only recurse when the LHS is a CONCAT or
	LIST).	Fixing bug in db_close function to check if the instance
	tree has been populated before deallocating memory for it.  Fixing
	bug in report help information when Tcl/Tk is not available.  Added
	bassign2 diagnostic to regression suite to verify first described
	bug.

2006-01-02 15:35  phase1geo

	Added simulation performance statistical information to end of
	score command when we are in debug mode.

2005-12-30 23:00  phase1geo

	Updating regression due to recent changes in adding exec_num field
	in expression and removing the executed bit in the expression
	supplemental field.  This will eventually allow us to get
	information on where the simulator is spending the most time.

2005-12-30 21:30  phase1geo

	Various documentation updates.

2005-12-23 14:59  phase1geo

	Fixing assertion error in race condition checker.  Full regression
	runs cleanly.

2005-12-22 23:41  phase1geo

	Fixing several bugs in score command per bug report #1388339. 
	Fixed problem with race condition checker statement iterator to
	eliminate infinite looping (this was the problem in the original
	bug).  Also fixed expression assigment when static expressions are
	used in the LHS (caused an assertion failure).	Also fixed the race
	condition checker to properly pay attention to task calls, named
	blocks and fork statements to make sure that these are being
	handled correctly for race condition checking.	Fixed bug for
	signals that are on the LHS side of an assignment expression but is
	not being assigned (bit selects) so that these are NOT considered
	for race conditions.  Full regression is a bit broken now but the
	opened bug can now be closed.

	now been eliminated from regression -- just left-over memory issues
	remain.

2005-12-18 23:18  phase1geo

	Fixing memory leak problems with instance1.1.  Full regression has
	some segfaults that need to be looked at now.

2005-12-16 23:47  phase1geo

	More memory fault fixes.  Regression runs cleanly and we have
	verified no memory faults up to define3.v.  Still have a ways to
	go.

2005-12-16 17:26  phase1geo

	Last set of memory leak fixes to get all assign diagnostics to run
	cleanly.

	Checkpointing some more memory fault fixes.

2005-12-14 17:03  phase1geo

	full regression passes.

2005-12-13 17:15  phase1geo

	More fixes for memory leaks.  Regression fully passes at this
	point.

2005-12-12 17:25  phase1geo

	Fixing memory faults.  This is a work in progress.

2005-12-11 23:40  phase1geo

	Adding valgrind to Makefile (temporary solution for now)

2005-12-11 21:46  phase1geo

	Adding exclusion to score command to improve performance.  Updated
	regression which now fully passes.

2005-12-10 00:41  phase1geo

	Added support for FOR loops and added diagnostics to regression
	suite to verify functionality.	Fixed statement deallocation
	function (removed a bunch of code there now that statement stopping
	is working as intended).  Full regression passes.

2005-12-08 16:50  phase1geo

	Adding support for while loops.  Added while1 and while1.1 to
	regression suite.  Ran VCS on regression suite and updated.  Full
	regression passes.

2005-12-08 13:46  phase1geo

	Fixed repeat2 simulation issues.  Fixed statement_connect
	algorithm, removed the need for a separate set_stop function and
	reshuffled the positions of esuppl bits.  Full regression passes.

2005-12-07 16:02  phase1geo

	Added new repeat2 diagnostic to regression suite.  This brings out
	a statement_connect error that still needs to be looked at --
	currently causes just this diagnostic to segfault.

2005-12-07 15:50  phase1geo

	Added support for repeat blocks.  Added repeat1 to regression and
	fixed errors.  Full regression passes.

2005-12-07 14:23  phase1geo

	Fixing case where statement is unconnectable.  Full regression now
	passes.

2005-12-06 13:40  phase1geo

	Updating regression for VCS run.  Added regression restart ability
	to Makefiles when problems/errors occur for a given regression run
	(only reruns failed/unrun diagnostics the next time a regression is
	run).  Full regression passes at this point.

2005-12-06 09:42  phase1geo

	Added disable2.1 diagnostic to regression suite.  Fixed bad output
	from line coverage reports.  Full regression passes.

2005-12-05 17:30  phase1geo

	Adding support for disabling tasks.  Full regression passes.

2005-12-05 16:45  phase1geo

	Bug fixes to disable code when disabling ourselves -- we move
	thread killing to be done by the sim_thread routine only.

2005-12-05 16:02  phase1geo

	Added initial support for disable expression.  Added test to verify
	functionality.	Full regression passes.

2005-12-05 15:28  phase1geo

	Getting fork statements with scope to work.  Added test to
	regression to verify this functionality.  Fixed bug in binding
	expression to named block.

2005-12-05 14:26  phase1geo

	Fixing bugs in code to remove statement blocks that are pointed to
	by expressions in NB_CALL and FORK cases.  Fixed bugs in fork code
	-- this is now working at the moment.  Updated regressions which
	now fully pass.

2005-12-02 13:58  phase1geo

	Added initial support for FORK/JOIN expressions.  Code is not
	working correctly yet as we need to determine if a statement should
	be done in parallel or not.

2005-12-02 06:03  phase1geo

	Adding support for excluding functions, tasks and named blocks. 
	Added tests to regression suite to verify this support.  Full
	regression passes.

2005-12-01 23:46  phase1geo

	Fixing compile errors when HAVE_TCLTK is defined in config.h.

2005-12-01 16:17  phase1geo

	Adding new diagnostics to test exclusion properties of modules,
	functions, tasks and named_blocks.  Full regression fails at this
	point with most of new diagnostics.

2005-12-01 15:11  phase1geo

	Adding more error checking diagnostics into regression suite.  Full
	regression passes.

2005-12-01 14:49  phase1geo

	Adding nested_block3 to verify nested named blocks in tasks.  Fixed
	named block usage to be FUNC_CALL or TASK_CALL -like based on its
	placement.

2005-12-01 13:46  phase1geo

	Removed Tcl/Tk from source files if HAVE_TCLTK is not defined.

2005-12-01 12:35  phase1geo

	Fixing bug where functions in continuous assignments could cause
	the assignment to constantly be reevaluated (infinite looping). 
	Added new nested_block2 diagnostic to verify nested named blocks in
	functions.  Also verifies that nested named blocks can call
	functions in the same module.  Also modified NB_CALL expressions to
	act like functions (no context switching involved).  Full
	regression passes.

2005-12-01 10:08  phase1geo

	Allowing nested functional units within a module to get parsed and
	handled correctly.  Added new nested_block1 diagnostic to test
	nested named blocks -- will add more tests later for different
	combinations.  Updated regression suite which now passes.

2005-11-30 12:25  phase1geo

	Fixing named block code.  Full regression now passes.  Still more
	work to do on named blocks, however.

2005-11-29 17:14  phase1geo

	Adding support for named blocks.  Still not working at this point
	but checkpointing anyways.  Added new task3.1 diagnostic to verify
	task removal when a task is calling another task.

2005-11-29 13:04  phase1geo

	Adding tests to verify task functionality.  Updating failing tests
	and fixed bugs for context switch expressions at the end of a
	statement block, statement block removal for missing function/tasks
	and thread killing.

2005-11-29 09:02  phase1geo

	Adding task3 diagnostic to regression suite.

2005-11-28 17:28  phase1geo

	Checkpointing with additions for threads.

2005-11-27 23:45  phase1geo

	Adding new task diagnostics to regression suite.

2005-11-25 16:03  phase1geo

	Fixing bugs in race condition checker when racing statement blocks
	are in different functional units.  Still some work to do here with
	what to do when conflicting statement block is in a task/function
	(I suppose we need to remove the calling statement block as well?)

2005-11-25 10:48  phase1geo

	Fixing bugs in binding algorithm.  Full regression now passes.

2005-11-23 17:10  phase1geo

	Updating TODO.

2005-11-23 17:05  phase1geo

	Updating regression files.  Full regression now passes.

2005-11-23 17:03  phase1geo

	Fixing statement block removal to do it after binding and race
	condition checking.

2005-11-22 17:03  phase1geo

	Adding support for event trigger mechanism.  Regression is
	currently broke due to these changes -- we need to remove statement
	blocks that contain triggers that are not simulated.

2005-11-22 10:46  phase1geo

	Fixed bug with clearing the assigned bit in the binding phase. 
	Full regression now runs cleanly.

2005-11-21 23:30  phase1geo

	Updates to regression suite for clearing the assigned bit when a
	statement block is removed from coverage consideration and it is
	assigning that signal.	This is not fully working at this point.

2005-11-21 17:31  phase1geo

	Adding support for initial statement blocks.  Added first initial1
	diagnostic to regression suite.  This support seems to be working
	for the moment -- still need to run regressions.

2005-11-21 16:21  phase1geo

	More regression updates.  Also made some updates to debugging
	output.

2005-11-20 22:37  phase1geo

	Miscellaneous updates.

2005-11-20 22:17  phase1geo

	More updates to regression suite -- includes several bug fixes. 
	Also added --enable-debug facility to configuration file which will
	include or exclude debugging output from being generated.

2005-11-18 17:52  phase1geo

	More regression cleanup -- still quite a few errors to handle here.

2005-11-17 23:17  phase1geo

	Updating regressions with latest round of changes.  Also added
	bit-fill capability to expression_assign function -- still more
	changes to come.  We need to fix the expression sizing problem for
	RHS expressions of assignment operators.

2005-11-17 17:35  phase1geo

	Blocking assignment is now working properly along with support for
	event expressions (currently only the original PEDGE, NEDGE, AEDGE
	and DELAY are supported but more can now follow).  Added new race4
	diagnostic to verify that a register cannot be assigned from more
	than one location -- this works.  Regression fails at this point.

2005-11-16 23:34  phase1geo

	Initial work on supporting blocking assignments.  Added new
	diagnostic to check that this initial work is working correctly. 
	Quite a bit more work to do here.

2005-11-16 17:02  phase1geo

	Added new diagnostics to check for functions that contain
	time-consuming expressions (this is not allowed by Covered -- and
	not by most commercial simulators either).  Updated check_test to
	do error checking and added error outputs.  Full regression passes
	at this point -- 225 diagnostics.

2005-11-16 16:07  phase1geo

	Now full regression runs without error.

2005-11-16 16:01  phase1geo

	Fixing more problems related to simulation of function/task calls. 
	Regression runs are now running without errors.

2005-11-16 13:47  phase1geo

	Updating VCS-only diagnostic files.

2005-11-15 23:50  phase1geo

	Fixing binding with merge command.

2005-11-15 23:41  phase1geo

	Fixing implicit signal creation in binding functions.

2005-11-15 17:08  phase1geo

	Updates for new binding scheme.  Binding occurs for all
	expressions, signals, FSMs, and functional units after parsing has
	completed or after database reading has been completed.  This
	should allow for any hierarchical reference or scope issues to be
	handled correctly.  Regression mostly passes but there are still a
	few failures at this point.  Checkpointing.

2005-11-11 17:29  phase1geo

	Checkpointing some work in progress.  This will cause compile
	errors.  In the process of moving db read expression signal binding
	from vsignal output to expression output so that we can just call
	the binder in the expression_db_read function.

2005-11-11 16:53  phase1geo

	Updated bind process to allow binding of structures from different
	hierarchies.  Added task port signals to get added.

2005-11-10 17:27  phase1geo

	Adding scope files to handle scope searching.  The functions are
	complete (not debugged) but are not as of yet used anywhere in the
	code.  Added new func2 diagnostic which brings out scoping issues
	for functions.

2005-11-10 13:28  phase1geo

	Updates/fixes for tasks/functions.  Also updated Tcl/Tk scripts for
	these changes.	Fixed bug with net_decl_assign statements -- the
	line, start column and end column information was incorrect,
	causing problems with the GUI output.

2005-11-08 17:11  phase1geo

	Fixes for function/task additions.  Still a lot of testing on these
	structures; however, regressions now pass again so we are
	checkpointing here.

2005-06-23 11:06  phase1geo

	Updating report files due to extra space for module/instance name.

2005-06-15 17:13  phase1geo

	Updates to include signal callbacks and integration with Covered's
	simulation core.

	Adding symlinks to needed files.

2005-06-10 15:50  phase1geo

	Initial addition of vpi source files (just trying to get them into
	the database for now).

2005-05-11 07:39  phase1geo

	Removed vpi_user.h to allow us to work with other simulators or
	other versions of Icarus Verilog.

2005-05-08 22:08  phase1geo

	Intermediate checkin for VPI changes.  Also contains parser fix
	which should be branch applied to the latest stable and development
	versions.

2005-05-02 10:38  phase1geo

	Potential fix for older release backward compatibility.

2005-05-02 10:33  phase1geo

	Updates.

2005-05-02 00:00  phase1geo

	Start of adding VPI support to Covered.  Still a ways to go at this
	point.

2005-03-04 23:16  phase1geo

	Adding patch to parser.y to fix compiling problems with parser.y
	via bison-2.0.

2005-02-16 07:44  phase1geo

	Adding value propagation function to vsignal.c and adding this
	propagation to BASSIGN expression assignment after the assignment
	occurs.

2005-02-11 16:58  phase1geo

	Missed a file from the last submission.

2005-02-11 16:49  phase1geo

	Fixing bug with removing statement blocks that contain statements
	that cannot currently be handled by Covered correctly.	There was a
	problem when the bad statement was the last statement in the
	statement block.  Updated regression accordingly.  Added race
	condition diagnostics that currently are not in regression due to
	lack of code support for them.	Ifdef'ed out the BASSIGN stuff for
	this checkin.

2005-02-09 08:11  phase1geo

	More code for supporting expression assignments.

2005-02-08 17:18  phase1geo

	Starting to add code to handle expression assignment for blocking
	assignments.  At this point, regressions will probably still pass
	but new code isn't doing exactly what I want.

2005-02-07 22:05  phase1geo

	Final checkin for next development release.

2005-02-07 17:47  phase1geo

	Also added code to output toggle and combinational logic output to
	information bar when cursor is over an expression that, when
	clicked on, will take you to the detailed coverage window.

2005-02-07 11:37  phase1geo

	Fixing bug in process_file.tcl script where start_line and end_line
	global variables were being assigned when they should not have
	been.

2005-02-06 23:10  phase1geo

	Fixing bug in statement_get_last_line calculator.  Updated
	regression for this fix.

2005-02-05 00:47  phase1geo

	Fixing bug with race condition output in instance reporting. 
	Changing default report output of race conditions to false and
	updating in-line documentation.  Added rules in regression runs for
	specifically testing race condition output.  Updated regression
	files for these changes.  Regression runs clean at this point.	We
	just need to add user documentation for the race condition feature
	add and we should be done.

2005-02-05 00:20  phase1geo

	Added ascii report output for race conditions.	There is a
	segmentation fault bug associated with instance reporting.  Need to
	look into further.

2005-02-04 23:29  phase1geo

	Added race condition reporting to GUI.

2005-02-04 22:13  phase1geo

	Started to add reporting capabilities for race condition
	information.  Modified race condition reason calculation and
	handling.  Ran -Wall on all code and cleaned things up.  Cleaned up
	regression as a result of these changes.  Full regression now
	passes.

2005-02-04 17:55  phase1geo

	Adding code to support race condition information in CDD files. 
	All code is now in place for writing/reading this data to/from the
	CDD file (although nothing is currently done with it and it is
	currently untested).

2005-02-04 13:38  phase1geo

	Adding new race condition checking diagnostics.  Updated all
	regression diagnostics that failed with new changes to remove race
	condition code.  Regression now runs cleanly will all race
	condition checking code.

	Added race1.1 to regression.  Removed unnecessary output statements
	from previous debugging checkins.

2005-01-24 07:21  phase1geo

	Modifying unlinking algorithm for statement links.  Still getting
	segmentation fault at this time.

2005-01-11 08:24  phase1geo

	Intermediate checkin.

2005-01-10 17:23  phase1geo

	Adding race1 diagnostic to regression suite.

	regression suite yet).	Updating CDD files for latest changes.

2005-01-10 07:44  phase1geo

	statements that do not overlap.  We do not have race conditions in
	this case.

2005-01-09 20:59  phase1geo

	being assigned in multiple statements.	Working on handling bit
	selects -- this is in progress.

2005-01-07 17:29  phase1geo

	diagnostic to verify this functionality.  Updated regressions for
	this change.

2005-01-07 16:59  phase1geo

	Regression now passes for previous changes.  Also added ability to
	properly convert quoted strings to vectors and vectors to quoted
	strings.  This will allow us to support strings in expressions. 
	This is a known good.

2005-01-07 11:59  phase1geo

	Finalized updates for supplemental field changes.  Everything
	compiles and links correctly at this time; however, a regression
	run has not confirmed the changes.

2005-01-06 17:51  phase1geo

	Intermediate checkin.  Files don't fully compile yet.

2005-01-06 08:32  phase1geo

	Starting to make updates to supplemental fields.  Work is in
	progress.

2005-01-04 08:37  phase1geo

	Updates to install user and GUI documentation.

2004-12-06 13:07  phase1geo

	Adding Makefile.am to GUI documentation directory.  Updated
	configure.in for this change.  We need to run autoconf (later
	version) to generate new configure.
