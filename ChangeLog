2006-09-01 18:06  phase1geo

	Updating .coveredrc file for default values.

2006-09-01 18:04  phase1geo

	Fixing regressions per latest round of changes.  Full regression
	now passes.

2006-08-31 23:06  phase1geo

	Added code to support more than one instance tree.  Currently, I am
	seeing quite a few memory errors that are causing some major
	problems at the moment.  Checkpointing.

2006-08-31 17:32  phase1geo

	Things are in a state of flux at the moment.  I have added proper
	parsing support for assertions, properties and sequences.  Also
	added partial support for the $root space (though I need to work on
	figuring out how to handle it in terms of the instance tree) and
	all that goes along with that.	Add parsing support with an error
	message for multi-dimensional array declarations.  Regressions
	should not be expected to run correctly at the moment.

2006-08-30 23:06  phase1geo

	Updating user documentation for supported SystemVerilog constructs.

2006-08-30 23:04  phase1geo

	Adding assert1 diagnostic to regression suite.

2006-08-30 23:02  phase1geo

	Adding parsing support for assertions and properties.  Adding
	feature to highlighting support that looks up the generation for
	the given module and highlights accordingly.

2006-08-30 17:37  phase1geo

	Adding more enumeration diagnostics.

2006-08-30 07:02  phase1geo

	Changing assertion in vcd.c that fails when the VCD file is
	improperly formatted to a user error message with a bit more
	meaning.  Fixing problem with signedness of enumeration resolution.
	 Added enum1.1 diagnostic to testsuite.

2006-08-29 21:37  phase1geo

	Updating build scripts and adding mem2 diagnostic from stable
	branch.  Full IV regressions pass.

2006-08-29 17:49  phase1geo

	Added enumeration support and partial support for typedefs.  Added
	enum1 diagnostic to verify initial enumeration support.  Full
	regression has not been run at this point -- checkpointing.

2006-08-28 21:51  phase1geo

	Adding enumeration parsing support to parser.  No functionality at
	this point, however.

2006-08-28 17:28  phase1geo

	Fixing bug 1546059 to match stable branch.  Adding support for
	repeated delay expressions (i.e., a = repeat(2) @(b) c).  Fixing
	support for event delayed assignments (i.e., a = @(b) c).  Adding
	several new diagnostics to verify this new level of support and
	updating regressions for these changes.  Also added parser support
	for logic port types.

2006-08-25 21:38  phase1geo

	Adding Verilog-2001 and SystemVerilog keywords to verilog.tcl
	script.  Updating build files for development release date of
	9/2/2006.  Updated TODO.

2006-08-25 21:23  phase1geo

	Fixing IV regression failures.	Full IV regression now passes.

2006-08-25 17:49  phase1geo

	Adding support for handling generated hierarchical names in signals
	that are outside of generate blocks.  Added support for
	op-and-assigns in generate for loops as well as normal for loops. 
	Added generate11.4 and for3 diagnostics to regression suite to
	verify this new behavior.  Full regressions have not been verified
	with these changes however.  Checkpointing.

2006-08-25 13:25  phase1geo

	Modified gen39 and gen40 to not use the Verilog-2001 port syntax. 
	Fixed problem with detecting implicit .name and .* syntax.  Fixed
	op-and-assign report output.  Added support for 'typedef',
	'struct', 'union' and 'enum' syntax for SystemVerilog.	Updated
	user documentation.  Full regression completely passes now.

2006-08-24 17:25  phase1geo

	Fixing issue with generate expressions within signal hierarchies. 
	Also added ability to parse implicit named and * port lists.  Added
	diagnostics to regressions to verify this new ability.	Full
	regression passes.

2006-08-23 22:40  phase1geo

	Updating build files.

2006-08-23 22:39  phase1geo

	Fixing some issues with new static_lexer/parser.  Working on
	debugging issue related to the generate variable mysteriously
	losing its vector data.

2006-08-23 17:22  phase1geo

	Adding VCD files generated from VCS for generate11.2 and
	generate11.3.  Also making needed tweak to lexer.l.

2006-08-23 17:18  phase1geo

	Adding static expression parser/lexer for parsing generate signals.
	 Integrated this into gen_item.  First attempt and hasn't been
	tested, so I'm sure its full of bugs at the moment.

2006-08-22 16:46  phase1geo

	Updating from stable branch.

2006-08-21 23:16  phase1geo

	Updating user documentation.

2006-08-21 23:00  phase1geo

	Fixing bugs 1544322 and 1544325.  Updating regressions per these
	changes.  Full IV regression now passes.

2006-08-21 17:49  phase1geo

	Adding more support for delayed assignments.  Added dly_assign1 to
	testsuite to verify the #... type of delayed assignment.  This
	seems to be working for this case but has a potential issue in the
	report generation.  Checkpointing work.

2006-08-21 12:50  phase1geo

	Updating regressions for VCS runs.

2006-08-19 22:20  phase1geo

	Adding support for +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=, <<<=,
	>>>=, ++ and -- operators.  The op-and-assign operators are
	currently good for simulation and code generation purposes but
	still need work in the comb.c file for proper combinational logic
	underline and reporting support.  The increment and decrement
	operations should be fully supported with the exception of their
	use in FOR loops (I'm not sure if this is supported by
	SystemVerilog or not yet).  Also started adding support for delayed
	assignments; however, I need to rework this completely as it
	currently causes segfaults.  Added lots of new diagnostics to
	verify this new functionality and updated regression for these
	changes.  Full IV regression now passes.

2006-08-18 20:41  phase1geo

	Updating documentation for the -B global option and updating build
	files.

2006-08-18 17:41  phase1geo

	Adding enumerated values for the operate-and-assign SystemVerilog
	operations.

2006-08-18 17:32  phase1geo

	Adding get_dirname routine to util.c for future use.

2006-08-18 17:19  phase1geo

	Fully integrated obfuscation into the development release.

2006-08-18 17:07  phase1geo

	Integrating obfuscation into all user-viewable output.	Verified
	that these changes have not made an impact on regressions.  Also
	improved performance impact of not obfuscating output.

2006-08-17 23:41  phase1geo

	Incorporating bug fixes 1538920 and 1541944.  Updated regressions. 
	Only event1.1 does not currently pass (this does not pass in the
	stable version yet either).

2006-08-16 23:30  phase1geo

	Adding obfuscate ability though this is currently not integrated
	into the core at this point.  Updated makefiles for this change.

2006-08-16 12:59  phase1geo

	Fixing things for good now (after the last submission).  Full
	regression passes with the exception of generate11.2 and
	generate11.3.

2006-08-16 12:20  phase1geo

	Adding support for SystemVerilog data types bit, logic, byte, char,
	shortint, int, and longint.  Added diagnostics to verify correct
	behavior.  Also added generate11.2 and generate11.3 diagnostics
	which show a shortfall in Covered's handling of generate
	expressions within hierarchy names.

2006-08-16 10:32  phase1geo

	Fixing issues with do..while loop handling.  Full regression now
	passes.

2006-08-15 11:21  phase1geo

	Fixing bug for generate4 diagnostic which incorrectly added a BIND
	element when not in a generate block.  Full regression now passes.

2006-08-13 23:19  phase1geo

	Fixing problem with generate11* diagnostics (generate variable used
	in signal name).  These tests pass now but full regression hasn't
	been verified at this point.

2006-08-11 17:36  phase1geo

	Fixing bug 1538922.

2006-08-11 16:27  phase1geo

	Adding support for unique, priority and do..while SystemVerilog
	constructs.  do_while2 diagnostic is currently failing with an
	issue regarding connecting its false path to the top of its always
	block.	Otherwise, full regression should be passing (with the
	exception of the problem with the assigned bit due to changes for
	generate11).

2006-08-11 13:57  phase1geo

	Adding support for always_comb, always_latch and always_ff
	statement block types.	Added several diagnostics to regression
	suite to verify this new behavior.

2006-08-11 10:16  phase1geo

	Joining slist3.3 diagnostic to latest development branch.  Adding
	changes to fix memory issues from bug 1535412.

2006-08-10 17:35  phase1geo

	Updating with fixes for upcoming 0.4.7 stable release.	Updated
	regressions for this change.  Full regression still fails due to an
	unrelated issue.

2006-08-06 00:02  phase1geo

	Documenting and adding warning message to parse.c for the -rI
	option.

2006-08-05 23:36  phase1geo

	Fixing bugs 1533896 and 1533827.  Also added -rI option that will
	ignore the race condition check altogether (has not been verified
	to this point, however).

2006-08-02 17:28  phase1geo

	Attempting to fix the bug pulled out by generate11.v.  We are just
	having an issue with setting the assigned bit in a signal
	expression that contains a hierarchical reference using a genvar
	reference.  Adding generate11.1 diagnostic to verify a slightly
	different syntax style for the same code.  Note sure how badly I
	broke regression at this point.

2006-08-01 16:14  phase1geo

	Adding new generate diagnostic and fixing syntax error in lexer.l
	to allow hierarchical referencing using genvar names within square
	brackets.  The new diagnostic fails currently.

2006-08-01 13:51  phase1geo

	Adding more diagnostics to testsuite to verify correct behavior of
	generate blocks.  Full regression passes.  I think that we are
	pretty close to fully testing generate blocks.

2006-08-01 13:05  phase1geo

	Adding more diagnostics to test generate item structure
	connectivity.  Fixing bug in funit_find_signal function to search
	the function (instead of the instance for for finding a signal to
	bind).

2006-08-01 11:22  phase1geo

	Removed incorrect assertion in score.c and replaced it with an if
	statement.  Updated regressions for recent changes.  Full
	regression now passes.

2006-07-31 23:47  phase1geo

	Adding generate9.3 diagnostic to regression suite (still need to
	verify that it passes, however).

2006-07-31 23:38  phase1geo

	Fixing issues with binding to non-module scope and not binding
	references that reference a "no score" module.	Full regression
	passes.

2006-07-31 17:11  phase1geo

	Fixing bug with generated tasks.  Added diagnostic to test generate
	functions (this is currently failing with a binding issue).

2006-07-31 11:26  phase1geo

	Tweaking the is_static_only function to consider expressions using
	generate variables to be static.  Updating regression for changes. 
	Full regression now passes.

2006-07-30 00:00  phase1geo

	Adding generate8.2 to regression list (VCS-only).

2006-07-29 23:59  phase1geo

	Modifying db_find_signal to use scope lookup function (for upwards
	name referencing purposes).  Emits user error if specified signal
	could not be found (we are understanding that if the db_find_signal
	function is used, the signal better be within the current scope (no
	hierarchical referencing allowed).  Diagnostic generate8.2 should
	work now with VCS.

2006-07-29 23:30  phase1geo

	Adding generate8.2 diagnostic which uses nested generate loops. 
	The problem with Covered with this diagnostic is not in the nested
	for loops but rather it currently does not bind generate variables
	with TFN generate items.

2006-07-29 16:15  phase1geo

	Fixing last issue with generate8.1.v.  Full regression passes with
	IV.  Still need to check VCS regression run.

2006-07-29 15:53  phase1geo

	Fixing some code related to generate statements; however,
	generate8.1 is still not completely working at this point.  Full
	regression passes for IV.

2006-07-28 17:42  phase1geo

	Updates to support expression/signal binding for expressions within
	a generate block statement block.

2006-07-28 11:30  phase1geo

	Fixing one last regression error.  We are now ready to make a tag.

2006-07-27 16:19  phase1geo

	Small updates.

2006-07-27 13:02  phase1geo

	More diagnostic additions and upgraded the generate item display
	functionality for better debugging using this feature.	We are
	about to forge into some new territory with regard to generate
	blocks, so we will tag at this point.

2006-07-27 11:27  phase1geo

	Adding diagnostics to verify basic generate case blocks.  Full
	regression passes.

2006-07-27 11:08  phase1geo

	Fixing several memory leak bugs, cleaning up output and fixing
	regression bugs.  Full regression now passes (including all current
	generate diagnostics).

2006-07-26 23:34  phase1geo

	Adding initial support for generate case statements.  This has only
	been verified to compile at this point.

2006-07-26 21:14  phase1geo

	Cleaning up verbose output and fixing a few bugs for regression. 
	IV regression passes at this point.

2006-07-26 21:04  phase1geo

	Fixing problem with parameter usage in a generate block for signal
	sizing.

2006-07-26 01:22  phase1geo

	Fixing rest of issues with generate6 diagnostic.  Still need to
	know if I have broken regressions or not and there are plenty of
	cases in this area to test before I call things good.

2006-07-25 22:33  phase1geo

	Update to named block scoping function.  Searching relatively
	before searching broadly; however, this is not working quite as
	expected yet.  More work to come.

2006-07-25 16:35  phase1geo

	Fixing nested namespace problem with generate blocks.  Also adding
	support for using generate values in expressions.  Still not quite
	working correctly yet, but the format of the CDD file looks good as
	far as I can tell at this point.

2006-07-24 17:20  phase1geo

	Things are quite hosed at the moment -- trying to come up with a
	scheme to handle embedded hierarchy in generate blocks.  Chances
	are that a lot of things are currently broken at the moment.

2006-07-24 13:22  phase1geo

	Making tweak to check_test script to not stop on assertion failure
	(prior to CDD file being created).  All tests in regression pass at
	this point with the exception of generate6.

2006-07-24 08:35  phase1geo

	More generate updates.

2006-07-21 23:28  phase1geo

	Adding generate6 diagnostic to pull out problems with adding scopes
	inside of generate loops.  Problem still exists in the code at this
	time.

2006-07-21 22:57  phase1geo

	Adding support for parameters within generate blocks.  Adding more
	diagnostics to verify statement support and parameter usage (signal
	sizing).

2006-07-21 20:17  phase1geo

	Fixing generate statement output function to output statements in
	the correct order.  Diagnostic generate5.v should now work
	correctly with VCS.

2006-07-21 17:39  phase1geo

	Started adding support for generated statements.  Still looks like
	I have some loose ends to tie here before I can call it good. 
	Added generate5 diagnostic to regression suite -- this does not
	quite pass at this point, however.

2006-07-21 15:12  phase1geo

	Fixing code to get generated instances and generated array of
	instances to work.  Added diagnostics to verify correct
	functionality.	Full regression passes.

2006-07-21 12:47  phase1geo

	Simple if and if-else generate statements are now working.  Added
	diagnostics to regression suite to verify these.  More testing to
	follow.

2006-07-21 10:52  phase1geo

	Checking in an initial working version of the generate structure. 
	Diagnostic generate1 passes.  Still a lot of work to go before we
	fully support generate statements, but this marks a working version
	to enhance on.	Full regression passes as well.

2006-07-21 00:47  phase1geo

	More code additions for generate functionality.  At this point, we
	seem to be creating proper generate item blocks and are creating
	the generate loop namespace appropriately.  However, the binder is
	still unable to find a signal created by a generate block.

2006-07-20 15:11  phase1geo

	More work on generate statements.  Trying to figure out a
	methodology for handling namespaces.  Still a lot of work to go...

2006-07-20 00:02  phase1geo

	Adding missing function declarations to keywords.h.

2006-07-19 23:55  phase1geo

	More updates to support generate blocks.  We seem to be passing the
	parser stage now.  Getting segfaults in the generate_resolve code,
	presently.

2006-07-19 17:30  phase1geo

	More work done for generate support.  Still have a ways to go.

2006-07-18 16:52  phase1geo

	More work on generate blocks.  Currently working on assembling
	generate item statements in the parser.  Still a lot of work to go
	here.

2006-07-18 14:03  phase1geo

	Sync'ing up to the scoping fixes from the 0.4.6 stable release.

2006-07-18 08:37  phase1geo

	Fixing compile issues.

2006-07-17 17:12  phase1geo

	Adding more code for generate block support.  Still just adding
	code at this point -- hopefully I haven't broke anything that
	doesn't use generate blocks.

2006-07-15 23:16  phase1geo

	Finishing testing on new -g option.  Full regression now passes.

2006-07-15 17:07  phase1geo

	Added all code to parser to check generation value to decide if a
	piece of syntax is allowable by the parser or not.  This code
	compiles and has been proven to not break regressions; however,
	none if it has been tested at this point.  Many regression tests to
	follow...

2006-07-15 00:49  phase1geo

	Removed the old manstyle documentation directory as this tool is no
	longer used to generate user documentation.  Created new keywords
	files to break out 1995, 2001 and SystemVerilog syntax.  Added
	several new diagnostics to regression suite to verify this new
	feature (still more parser code to add to completely support this
	feature).  Also fixed several bugs that existed in the 0.4.5 stable
	release and added those tests.	Full regression is passing. 
	Finally, updated the manpage for the new -g option to the score
	command.  Still need to document this new option in the user's
	guide.	Added ability to verify the -g option diagnostics to the
	regression suite.

2006-07-14 13:53  phase1geo

	Fixing -g option for keywords.	This seems to be working and I
	believe that regressions are passing here as well.

2006-07-13 17:24  phase1geo

	We are really broke at this time; however, more code has been added
	to support the -g score option.

2006-07-13 16:03  phase1geo

	Fixing bug in db_read function to set curr_funit to the correct
	structure when merging functional units.  Updated regressions per
	this fix.

2006-07-13 00:31  phase1geo

	Adding -g option to score command parser/usage information.  Still
	a lot of work to go before this feature is complete.

2006-07-12 23:35  phase1geo

	Fixing problem with unary inversion and logical not.  Updated
	unary1 failures as a result.  Still need to run full regression
	before considering this fully fixed.

2006-07-12 17:16  phase1geo

	Fixing hierarchical referencing for instance arrays.  Also
	attempted to fix a problem found with unary1; however, the
	generated report coverage information does not look correct at this
	time.  Checkpointing what I have done for now.

2006-07-11 09:49  phase1geo

	Modifying unary1 and adding a testcase to it.

2006-07-10 23:59  phase1geo

	Reworking the way that instances are being generated.  This is to
	fix a bug and pave the way for generate loops for instances.  Code
	not working at this point and may cause serious problems for
	regression runs.

2006-07-10 21:32  phase1geo

	Fixing memory leak problem in db_close function (with score_args).

2006-07-10 17:36  phase1geo

	Getting parser to parse generate blocks appropriately.	I believe
	this is accurate now.  Also added the beginnings of gen_item.c
	which is meant to hold functions which handle generate items.  This
	is really just a brainstorm at this point -- I still don't have a
	definite course of action on how to properly handle generate
	blocks.

2006-07-10 14:30  phase1geo

	Fixing bug in instance.c that ignored the LSB information for an
	instance array (this also needs to be fixed for the 0.4.6 stable
	release).  Added diagnostic to verify correctness of this behavior.
	 Also added case statement to the generate parser.

2006-07-09 22:05  phase1geo

	Contains bug fixes for memory leaks and segmentation faults.  Also
	contains some starting code to support generate blocks.  There is
	absolutely no functionality here, however.

2006-07-08 20:40  phase1geo

	Removing the vpi directory (again).  Also fixing a bug in Covered's
	expression deallocator where a case statement contains an
	unbindable signal.  Previously the case test expression was being
	deallocated twice.  This submission fixes this bug (bug was also
	fixed in the 0.4.5 stable release).  Added new tests to verify fix.
	 Full regression passes.

2006-07-08 00:24  phase1geo

	Updating covered.spec RPM file.
