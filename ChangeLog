2006-12-05 17:27  phase1geo

	Updates to user documentation to increase the width of viewable
	information.  This was necessary to accommodate the width of the
	score command options table.

2006-12-05 16:25  phase1geo

	Fixing VPI code to allow Cver and VCS regressions to pass.  With
	these simulators, we need to perform a time 0 timestep simulation.

2006-12-01 23:18  phase1geo

	Updating regressions, updating build scripts and updating
	documentation.

2006-12-01 17:24  phase1geo

	Small tweaks to diagnostic Makefile.

2006-12-01 17:08  phase1geo

	Last of the updates (I believe) for full regressions to pass for
	IV, Cver and VCS in both normal and VPI modes.

2006-12-01 15:40  phase1geo

	Fixing VPI bug in that initial values of signals were not being
	recorded because they were not considered to be value changes by
	the simulator.	Regressions are getting quite close to fully
	passing in all modes but there are still a few exceptions.

2006-12-01 13:14  phase1geo

	Fixing lib Makefile and configuration file to compile the
	covered.vpi module via Makefile (instead of the iverilog-vpi) to
	give us more debug output.  Also fixed some compilation warnings
	with vpi.c and IV.

2006-12-01 13:05  phase1geo

	Fixing the usage of -vpi_ts option.  Updating its -h usage
	information as well.

2006-11-30 16:14  phase1geo

	Updating lib/Makefile.am file to not use the iverilog-vpi utility
	for creating the covered.vpi module (allows us to control debugging
	information).

2006-11-30 13:58  phase1geo

	Fixing rest of issues so that full regression (IV, Cver and VCS)
	without VPI passes.  Updated regression files.

2006-11-29 23:04  phase1geo

	More fixes to new simulation algorithm.  Still have a couple of
	failures that need to be looked at.  Checkpointing.

2006-11-29 17:15  phase1geo

	Major overhaul to simulation engine by including an appropriate
	delay queue mechanism to handle simulation timing for delay
	operations.  Regression not fully passing at this moment but enough
	is working to checkpoint this work.

2006-11-28 10:39  phase1geo

	More updates for regressions due to changes in delay handling. 
	Still work to go.

2006-11-26 22:11  phase1geo

	Adding more changes to properly support thread time.  This is a
	work in progress and regression is currently broken for the moment.
	 Checkpointing.

2006-11-26 14:57  phase1geo

	Bug fixes and regression updates for timescale code.  This code
	should now be working correctly.

2006-11-25 23:23  phase1geo

	Adding several more timescale diagnostics to regression suite. 
	Still have a couple of failing diagnostics in normal regression
	runs.  Checkpointing.

2006-11-25 15:27  phase1geo

	Adding timescale diagnostics to regression suite and fixing bugs in
	core associated with this code.  Full regression now passes for IV
	and Cver (not in VPI mode).

2006-11-24 22:24  phase1geo

	Adding initial code to fully support the timescale directive and
	its usage.  Added -vpi_ts score option to allow the user to specify
	a top-level timescale value for the generated VPI file (this code
	has not been tested at this point, however).  Also updated
	diagnostic Makefile to get the VPI shared object files from the
	current lib directory (instead of the checked in one).

2006-11-24 13:40  phase1geo

	Updating Makefile to use correct VPI shared object files when
	running VPI regressions.

2006-11-23 23:35  phase1geo

	Updating cdd_diff script to use the normal diff procedure instead
	of the homegrown one.

2006-11-23 23:30  phase1geo

	Checking in fix for proper handling of delays.	This does not
	include the use of timescales (which will be fixed next).  Full IV
	regression now passes.

2006-11-23 21:44  phase1geo

	Correcting a few more files.

2006-11-23 21:38  phase1geo

	Adding missing files.

2006-11-23 21:38  phase1geo

	Updates for regression which is not fully passing at the moment. 
	Also added cdd_diff script for regression running purposes.

2006-11-22 14:20  phase1geo

	Updates to properly support 64-bit time.  Also starting to make
	changes to simulator to support "back simulation" for when the
	current simulation time has advanced out quite a bit of time and
	the simulator needs to catch up.  This last feature is not quite
	working at the moment and regressions are currently broken. 
	Checkpointing.

2006-11-21 20:25  phase1geo

	Updating build scripts.

2006-11-21 17:56  phase1geo

	More updates to VPI (still not working correctly, however).

2006-11-21 13:54  phase1geo

	Making modifications to defines.h to help in creating appropriately
	sized types.  Other changes to VPI code (but this is still broken
	at the moment).  Checkpointing.

2006-11-21 12:25  phase1geo

	Adding changeValue support for integer and time to VPI
	functionality.

2006-11-20 17:02  phase1geo

	Fixing convert_cfg script for the mbit_sel4*.v diagnostics.  Also
	removing unneeded output in vpi.c.

2006-11-20 15:36  phase1geo

	Fixing bug 1599869.  When a disable statement is found to not be
	covered, the codegen_gen_expr function returns the proper output
	(instead of unitialized output).

2006-11-17 17:17  phase1geo

	Fixing bug in score command where parameter override values were
	not being saved off properly in the CDD file.  Also fixing bug when
	a parameter is found in a VCD file (ignoring its usage).  Updated
	regressions for these changes.

2006-11-09 16:51  phase1geo

	Adding cver rule to regression Makefile to allow Cver regressions
	to be run.  Seeing quite a few errors in regression as it is
	(though I do not believe that Covered is broken at this point). 
	Checkpointing.

2006-11-09 16:26  phase1geo

	Finished work on Makefile to make it useful for Cver as well.

2006-11-09 12:12  phase1geo

	Fixing bug 1569819.  Added multi_exp4 diagnostic to regression
	suite to verify this fix.  Full regression passes.  Also started to
	add support for Cver to the regression testing Makefile -- still
	more work to go here.

2006-11-06 12:12  phase1geo

	Adding more signed parsing support to net declarations.  Added
	signed4.2 diagnostic to verify this support.  Updated regressions
	which now fully pass.

2006-11-03 17:36  phase1geo

	Fixing bug 1590104.  Updating regressions per this change.

2006-11-03 16:23  phase1geo

	Fixing bug 1545442.  Added report1 diagnostic to regression suite
	to verify this fix.

2006-11-03 15:28  phase1geo

	file report1.rptM was initially added on branch
	covered-0_4_5-branch.

2006-11-03 15:28  phase1geo

	file report1.rptI was initially added on branch
	covered-0_4_5-branch.

2006-11-03 15:28  phase1geo

	file report1.rptWI was initially added on branch
	covered-0_4_5-branch.

2006-11-03 15:28  phase1geo

	file report1.rptWM was initially added on branch
	covered-0_4_5-branch.

2006-11-03 15:28  phase1geo

	file report1.cfg was initially added on branch
	covered-0_4_5-branch.

2006-11-03 15:28  phase1geo

	file report1.cdd was initially added on branch
	covered-0_4_5-branch.

2006-11-03 15:28  phase1geo

	file report1.v was initially added on branch covered-0_4_5-branch.

2006-11-03 14:52  phase1geo

	Fixing bugs 1589519, 1589524 and 1589546.  Added signed4 and
	signed4.1 diagnostics to regression suite to verify its correct
	behavior.

2006-11-03 13:01  phase1geo

	Adding missing file.

2006-11-03 13:00  phase1geo

	Fixing bug 1589831.  Also added err3 and err3.1 diagnostics to
	verify its correct behavior.

2006-11-03 12:58  phase1geo

	Fixing bug 1589522.

2006-11-03 12:16  phase1geo

	Removing unnecessary spaces in comments.

2006-11-01 16:35  phase1geo

	Fixing bug dealing with sizing of parameters.  When the user does
	not explicitly set the parameter size, Covered was assuming this
	width to be 32 instead of the width of its assigned value.  Updated
	regressions for this change and added param15 to verify its
	correctness.  Full regression passes.

2006-10-26 16:58  phase1geo

	Starting to add support for Cver regression testing.

2006-10-25 17:35  phase1geo

	Starting to update testsuite to verify VPI mode as well.  Fixing
	runtime issues with vpi.c.  Also updated VL_error output format for
	easier readability.  Fixing bug in parser for statement blocks that
	do not contain RHS signals for implicit event expressions. 
	Updating regressions for these changes.

2006-10-22 22:27  phase1geo

	Adding slist5 diagnostic to replicate bug found in the field.

2006-10-22 22:25  phase1geo

	Starting to update help files using the new widget from HelpSystem
	1.5.

2006-10-20 20:54  phase1geo

	Started integrating HelpSystem into Covered's help menu.  Need to
	do a lot of work on creating the appropriate help files, but this
	is a good first start.

2006-10-20 17:28  phase1geo

	Adding conversion script to allow for VCD, LXT and VPI testing.

2006-10-20 11:56  phase1geo

	Documentation updates for missing -b option to report command as
	well as adding another FAQ item describing differences between
	stable and development releases.
