	Small fixes to preferences and verilog Tcl/Tk scripts.

2006-05-06 23:04  phase1geo

	Added symbol highlighting and added syntax highlighting to
	preferences window.  Still some work to do here to make sure that
	combinational logic verbose window gets updated when preferences
	are changed here.

2006-05-05 17:56  phase1geo

	Partially complete with Verilog syntax highlighting feature.  Still
	need to handle values and add stuff to preferences window for
	configuration of this feature.	Also need to tie syntax
	highlighting into the main source file viewer window.

2006-05-05 00:16  phase1geo

	Modifying format and rearranging user guide for addition of
	assertion coverage information.  This information still needs to be
	written at this time.

2006-05-03 20:54  phase1geo

	Updating configuration files and man documentation.

2006-05-03 17:49  phase1geo

	Causing all files to be preprocessed when written to the file

	I'm checkpointing here.

2006-05-03 16:21  phase1geo

	Updating TODO file.

2006-05-03 16:17  phase1geo

	Finishing assertion source code viewer functionality.  We just need
	to add documentation to the GUI user's guide and we should be set
	here (though we may want to consider doing some syntax highlighting
	at some point).

2006-05-02 17:06  phase1geo

	Fixing problem with passing score path to Tcl from C.

2006-05-02 16:49  phase1geo

	Updating regression files -- all but three diagnostics pass (due to
	known problems).  Added SCORE_ARGS line type to CDD format which
	stores the directory that the score command was executed from as
	well as the command-line arguments to the score command.

2006-05-02 09:14  phase1geo

	Updating configuration.

2006-05-01 17:27  phase1geo

	Enhancing the verbose assertion window.  Still need to fix a few
	bugs and add a few more enhancements.

2006-04-29 00:12  phase1geo

	Adding initial version of assertion verbose window.  This is
	currently working; however, I think that I want to enhance this
	window a bit more before calling it good.

2006-04-28 12:09  phase1geo

	Adding GUI support for assertion coverage.  Halfway there.

2006-04-24 23:53  phase1geo

	More work on the bug fix for parameter binding.  We are getting
	close, just need to debug a few problems from regression.  Also
	added is_constant bit to expression supplemental field to avoid
	displaying parameters in combinational logic (and this can be
	expanded for all expressions containing things like signals which
	do not change value during simulation.

2006-04-24 23:53  phase1geo

	the GUI.  Neither of these pages contain any pertinent information
	yet.

2006-04-23 22:01  phase1geo

	Starting to redo parameter/expression binding process.	We are not
	complete at this time, however.  Also adding param13.v diagnostic
	to test suite.

2006-04-21 17:03  phase1geo

	Adding ovl1 and ovl1.1 diagnostics to testsuite.  ovl1 passes while
	ovl1.1 currently fails due to a problem with outputting parameters
	to the CDD file (need to look into this further).  Added OVL
	assertion verbose output support which seems to be working for the
	moment.

2006-04-21 01:14  phase1geo

	Merged in changes from 0.4.3 stable release.  Updated all
	regression files for inclusion of OVL library.	More documentation
	updates for next development release (but there is more to go
	here).

2006-04-20 16:55  phase1geo

	Adding support for big endian signals.	Added new endian1
	diagnostic to regression suite to verify this new functionality. 
	Full regression passes.  We may want to do some more testing on
	variants of this before calling it ready for stable release 0.4.3.

2006-04-20 13:48  phase1geo

	Fixing bug in statement_connect function to force the last
	statement of a true path to get the stop_true and stop_false bits
	get set.

2006-04-19 17:21  phase1geo

	More updates to properly support assertion coverage.  Removing
	assertion modules from line, toggle, combinational logic, FSM and
	race condition output so that there won't be any overlap of
	information here.

2006-04-18 16:59  phase1geo

	Adding support for environment variable substitution in
	configuration files passed to the score command.  Adding
	ovl.c/ovl.h files.  Working on support for assertion coverage in
	report command.  Still have a bit to go here yet.

	changes.  Regression has been completely updated for these changes.

2006-04-13 23:40  phase1geo

	Updating configuration and Makefiles.

2006-04-13 17:17  phase1geo

	Adding the beginning of the OVL assertion extractor.  So far the -a
	option is parsed and the race condition checker is turned off for
	all detectable OVL assertion modules (we will trust that these
	modules don't have race conditions inherent in them).

2006-04-13 16:04  phase1geo

	Adding NOOP expression and allowing $display system calls to not
	cause its statement block to be excluded from coverage.  Updating
	regressions which fully pass.

2006-04-13 14:40  phase1geo

	Fixing bug in task_call parser that keeps subsequent task calls
	from causing a binding error.  This bug needs to be fixed in the
	stable release also.

	facility.  Full regression now passes.

2006-04-12 16:22  phase1geo

	Fixing problems with multi-file merging.  This now seems to be
	working as needed.  We just need to document this new feature.

2006-04-12 13:05  phase1geo

	Updating regressions for changes that were made to support
	multi-file merging.  Also fixing output of FSM state transitions to
	be what they were.  Regressions now pass; however, the support for
	multi-file merging (beyond two files) has not been tested to this
	point.

2006-04-12 08:28  phase1geo

	Fixing problem with memory allocation for merged files.

2006-04-11 17:42  phase1geo

	with newer version of auto* tools.

2006-04-07 17:30  phase1geo

	Fixes to get VPI to work with VCS.  Getting close but still some
	work to go to get the callbacks to start working.

	scheme.  We are getting close but still have a ways to go.

2006-04-05 22:08  phase1geo

	Updating TODO file.

2006-04-05 10:19  phase1geo

	Adding support for FSM coverage output in the GUI.  Started adding
	components for assertion coverage to GUI and report functions
	though there is no functional support for this at this time.
